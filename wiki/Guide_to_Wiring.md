# Guide to Wiring

So you're the unlucky guy trying to wire eh? Don't worry, i'll get you
through this kid. Lets start with the basics. Picture of basic power
setup (iron furnace and steam generator)

## Basics

1.  **The first thing you need to know is how to craft some of the
    things you're going to be using.** Wires (or cables) can be crafted
    with copper ingots in the electrical tab. To craft Engine's (such as
    the commonly used Hotbulb engine which runs off of any liquid fuel),
    you must have an engine maker in hand (made from 5 iron, not in a
    category), and steel in the other. With the engine maker in your
    active hand, press Z. This opens a window allowing you to select how
    many cc the engine will have. More cc = more electricity (1000 is
    about the most you need). This will then subtract the amount
    directly from the steel in your other hand.
2.  **Second, placing and cutting wires.** You can place cables by
    pressing Z with the cable coil in your active hand. This will place
    the cable directly beneath you heading in the direction you are
    facing. Wires that are visibly connected (say 2 horizontal cables
    side by side horizontally) will be automatically connected. However
    those that are facing different directions (such as vertically and
    horizontally) on the same tile will not be connected unless you
    place a connector over them.
3.  **Third, Creating Circuits**. With Creating full circuits, it's
    highly recommended **YOU DO ALL THE WIRING AT ONCE**. This means you
    don't wire, turn it on, turn it off, add a few lights. This
    sometimes breaks things. Instead its best to wire your entire
    circuit before you start it. This can help prevent issues later when
    the engine has a connecting cable that you removed, but it says is
    still there. It is possible to add lights to a circuit without it
    breaking, but its recommended only experienced electrical
    technicians attempt it.

## Crafting

In case you're a lazy turd that simply didn't want to know how to wire
and just do it trial and error, or already know how to wire but not
craft the necessities (How can you wire then?!).

  - Engines: Engine maker in one hand, steel in the other. With engine
    maker in active hand, press Z. Then specify cc (which subtracts from
    steel stack in hand).
  - Engine Maker: Press Z with iron ingots in hand. 5 iron ingots
    required.
  - Cables/Wires: Press Z with copper ingots in hand. In the
    "electrical" category, theres different colors of cables/wires. Each
    takes 1 ingot and gives 10 tiles/lengths of wire/cable.
  - Connectors: Press Z with copper ingots in hand. In the "electrical"
    category, at the top of the list should be cable connector. This
    takes 1 ingot and produces 1 connector.

### Motorcycles

it's 1903 eh? you got gas, a refinery, even gas pumps, but no vehicles.
Well you're in luck, this here guy'll teach you all the inner workings
of creating a motorcycle of your very own. Just follow these steps, oh
and uh, it'll require a bit of steel.

1.  Build a Motorcycle frame from steel in the "vehicle parts" category.
    Then Choose the HEX color of the bike. \#5C573D is recommended (\#
    not required)
2.  Next you need to build an engine. The 4 stroke gasoline engine is
    recommended since it's gasoline operated. Make an engine thats **AT
    MOST** 125cc. Means 125cc or lower can be put into a bike, otherwise
    it wont fit.
3.  Now we need to slap whatever engine you made into that sweet sweet
    frame of the bike. Simply drag the icon onto the bike's icon (not
    drag ICly, drag your mouse).
4.  All that's left then to add is a fuel tank. You can build one with
    steel in the "fuel tanks" category. You've got 3 choices. 75u bike
    tank is the biggest. (Only build bike tanks, fuel tanks won't fit).
    Then with the bike tank in hand, click on the bike and install that
    baby.
5.  Now you've successfully made a motorcycle. What you named it? No one
    cares. Who you made it for? No one cares, they'll likely steal it
    anyway. However, you're the man with the fuel! (hopefully)

### Motorcycle Operation

Bikes have 4 speeds (depending on the engine). Stopped (neutral), 1st
gear (moving but slower), and 2nd gear (moving faster than 1st), and 3rd
gear (fastest. You crash on this speed you're sure to break something,
or get across the map in a minute or less) Mount your bike by dragging
your icon onto the bike. You can get off by click on the bike with the
handle bars in hand (this also shuts off the bike. 2 clicks, shut off
the bike, and another to get off).You **turn on/increase speed of the
bike by pressing Z**. You can **stop/decrease speed by pressing C**.
Drive safe out there!
