# Civilizations and Nomads

***"I'm cold and starving, [WHAT DO I
DO?](Starter_Guide "wikilink")"***

*- A confused player*

## What is Civilizations and Nomads mode?

In Nomads, everyone spawns without any predetermined roles or **[Factions](Civilizations_and_Nomads#factions "wikilink")**. The **[map](Civilizations_and_Nomads#nomads-maps "wikilink")** is a complete wilderness, ready to be explored and settled. There are no prebuilt structures, except for occasional ancient ruins.

You can stay factionless (a nomad), create your own faction or join an existing one. Only members of a faction can research new technologies and accumulate research points.

A map may have one or more ethnicities, each speaking its own language initially incomprehensible to a speaker of a different language. On certain maps you can choose who you spawn as, while on other maps it is random.

There is no predetermined goal.

What will each civilization desire? Military power? World domination? Scholars with advanced technology? Mass resource output and production? Commerce and trade? Raiding? It’s up to you or your leaders to decide!

## What is RP Map mode?

In the RP mode, everyone chooses a role to play as before spawning. There may be one or more preset factions. The map has some prebuilt structures, but there is also plenty of space to expand with new buildings.

In this mode, the research level is fixed and cannot be advanced. In other words, the epoch is static (Middle Ages - 1013; Wild West - 1873; certain decades of the 20th century - 1940s, 1990s, etc.)

There may or may not be specific goals, which are listed at the start of the round. A brief outline for goals on different maps where they are present (mostly accumulating points for factions under certain conditions):

- Gulag (1946) - the prisoners - hold as much money as possible within your faction and escape; the camp guard - force the prisoners to work and send out the resources.
- **[The Art of the Deal](The_Art_of_the_Deal "wikilink")** (1994) - the company members - arrange deals to acquire disks and money; the police - jail company members and confiscate disks and money.

Maps without a set goal:

* Bohemia (1013) - live in a city in Medieval Europe.
* **[Colony](Colony "wikilink")** (1713) - build a New World colony (two maps with different climates).
* Little Creek (1873) - live in a Wild West town.
* Pioneers (1873) - develop a town in the prairies.

## What else is there?

There are also other modes and maps which are, effectively, a mix of the previous two modes, with a number of extra features. Currently it includes:

- **[Tribes](Tribes "wikilink")** - a fantasy mode with several different races (chosen randomly upon spawning), each forming a preset faction.

## Becoming Civilized

Perhaps you have noticed that your ability to craft things is a bit
limited in comparison to other people, and you would like to make more.
Perhaps you are finding surviving alone difficult. Perhaps you enjoy the
company and roleplay opportunity that comes with engaging with other
players. If those apply to you, then you should consider joining or
starting a faction.

The benefits of joining or assembling a faction:

  - You gain access to that factions research levels, which equates to
    [more things you can
    craft.](Civilizations_and_Nomads#the-research-milestones "wikilink")
  - More opportunity to roleplay in a manner you want to. From becoming
    a towns blacksmith, simple farmer, village idiot, to village
    chieftain, diplomat, emperor, or anything you want to try and make
    happen.
  - Depending on the faction, you might have access to shared resources
    and facilities.
  - Safety in numbers. Raiders will think twice before attacking a city,
    whereas a loner is an easy target for burglars, thieves, pillagers,
    and robbers.

### Factions

Factions are basically "teams". Everyone in the same faction shares the
same research points, and everyone in the faction contributes to
everyone else when they perform research.

But that also means that lazy people can take advantage of your
technology and resources and not contribute a thing...

A small tight-knit group of workers that contribute is often better off
than a large group of slackers that just consume.

Pick your members wisely\! Or cunningly use them to your advantage...

Work smart, not hard!

#### General

* To **Create** a faction, open the **Faction tab** and click **Create a faction**. Choose a name for it, as well as symbols and colours for you faction's banner.
* To join a faction, you must be **Recruited** by a faction member who has **recruitment permissions**.
* You can leave a faction by clicking **Abandon** on the **Faction tab**. Take note, that **you will not be able to rejoin the same faction for 24 hours!**
* Creating a faction makes you the default **Leader**.

#### As a Leader

  - You can invite people to your faction by getting close to them, **right-clicking** them, and selecting **Recruit** from the menu.
  - You **cannot** force someone to leave your faction; They have to **abandon** it themselves. How to get them to do that, is up to
    you...
  - You can make someone else a Leader by clicking **Transfer Leadership** on the **Faction tab** while near to your successor.
  - You can make **Announcements** that are received by every member of your faction. Open the **Officer tab** and select **Faction Announcement**.
  - You can delegate your power to other faction members by giving them certain **officer permissions**. **Right-click** a person and select **Faction Perms**. These are the permissions you can give or revoke, if the person already has them:
      - **Permission Management** - allows giving permissions per se.
      - **Announcements** 
      - **Giving Titles**
      - **Recruitment**

#### As a Member

  - You can ask the leader to give you **officer permissions**.
  - If the leader dies, anyone in the faction can recruit new members.
  - Anyone in the faction can become a new leader if the current one is dead, by clicking **Become Faction Leader** on the **Faction tab**.

## Research

Research is one of the most important aspects of Civilizations and
Nomads. It is with it that your faction can unlock new craftables and
better equipment\!

A small faction with advanced research and guns can usually topple the
big group of unga dunga cavemen armed with bows and arrows.

There are currently 4 modes of research.

Research mode is voted at the lobby, before the game begins.

Remember, **you need to create or join a faction to save research
points**\!

### Classic Research

The original research method\! And the most tedious...

Use a **Research Kit** on Scientific Literature, Scientific Rock Slate,
Scientific Books, or Bookcases.

You can make those with **wood** or **stone**.

The points you get depend on how advanced the person who wrote the
literature was, and what is the subject of their writing.

**TIP:** If you are struggling with your own research, progressing
slowly, it might be a good idea to see if any neighboring factions will
let you study their bookcases\! Buy, trade, and negotiate access to them
to boost your research. Or fight them, rob them... Get creative\!
(*within the rules*)

### Auto Research

As the name suggest, all factions in the world gain the same amount of
points in all areas at the same rate, without doing anything.

Sit back and relax. Or go plan a war against that one guy who looked at
you funny.

Just remember, if you can make guns, so can they...

### Resource-Based Research

In this mode, you create a **Research Bench** with **wood**, place any
items on it, and select a category to research.

This means that this mode rewards productivity and exploitation of
natural resources. No slacking off\!

Different items are worth different amounts.

Experiment\!

### No Research

In this mode, you're stuck in the epoch you started in, with all
technology of that epoch unlocked.

Research mechanics won't yield any improvements.

### Chad Mode

*It started as a joke, now it's too late to go back...*

Essentially it is No Research, but **without any IC rules whatsoever**.

Really. You can do anything you want, without any bwoinks. EXCEPT FOR
ERP.

### Chad Mode+

Just like Chad Mode, but with research! To do chad research, build an **Altar of Chad**. Slam living or dead people on it, and you get a bunch of research points - it's that easy! Living are worth 12, dead - 8.

**If a faction member is sacrificed to advance a certain category of research, that faction loses all their research points in that category!**

## Environments

The environment lives and breathes, and will be the single biggest
factor that influences your life\!

Each map has one or more different biomes. 

There are seasons of the year, effects of which are different in every biome. Some biomes have four seasons, while others have only two.

### Biomes and seasons

#### Tundra

* Snow covers the ground all year round and does not melt during summer (unlike in Temperate). 
* Wood and animals are rare here.

Seasons:

* Summer: Amene temperatures, some snow melts, revealing dirt, and crops can grow. No
  chance of snowfall or blizzard. Wild animals respawn.
* Winter: Icy temperatures requiring coat, high chance of snowfall,
  chance of deadly blizzard. Crops stop growing, snow covers all land.
  Have a shelter ready or you probably won't survive until summer.

#### Taiga

Similar to Tundra in many regards, but considerably more trees.

#### Temperate

Seasons (rotate every 30 minutes):

  - Spring: Amene temperatures, a little leftover snow from the winter.
    Sparse rains cause mud slowdowns. Snow starts melting.
  - Summer: Hot temperatures, no rain. Chance of heat-waves that
    evaporate all puddles. All snow melts. Wild animals respawn at a
    faster rate.
  - Fall: Cooler temperatures, sparse rain and occasional snowfall will
    slow you down.
  - Winter: Icy temperatures can kill you without a fur coat, some lakes
    and rivers freeze over, allowing you to walk on them. Constant
    snowfall slows you down, **crops will not grow and animals won't
    respawn**. Chance of blizzards that cause a whiteout, and can kill
    you even with fur coats. Have a shelter ready\!

#### Sea

#### Semi-Arid

#### Desert

Seasons:

  - Dry Season: All the water sources dry up, has a chance of
    sandstorms, which impair vision, but cause no other ill-effects.
    Heat is intense and can harm you if you stay in the sun too long.
  - Wet Season: All water sources fill up, sandstorms die down. Wild
    animals respawn.

#### Savanna

#### Jungle

Seasons:

* Dry Season: Fertile floodplains on the riverbanks are uncovered, sunny weather most of the time.
* Wet Season: Heavy rains and the arable land along the rivers is flooded.
