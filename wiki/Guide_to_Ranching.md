# Guide to Ranching
## Livestock

Well, from the very start of the Neolithic age, Humanity has started
domesticating animals.

## Reproduction

To simply get these animals to multiply, you have to have them in a
fairly small area and cramp them. For cows you need a bull and a cow
cramped in a fairly small area and they'll eventually get to it.
Chickens just need at least 2 and one needs to lay an egg and be sitting
on top of it for awhile. Try customizing your chicken coops making it so
they are unable to move off their egg.**(Only the cows, chickens, Deers,
Pigs, Sheep, Goats and turkey's can breed for now)**
