&nbsp; &nbsp; • <b>mushroom</b> - it's poison berries with <b>amatoxin</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; • <b>fruit and mushroom</b> - it's drug berries with <b>psilocybin</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; • <b>starch</b> - it's poison berries with <b>solanine</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; • <b>fruit and sourness</b> - it's drug berries with <b>lysergic acid diethylamide</b> &#91;mindbreaker or LSD&#93;<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; • <b>fruit</b> - it's neutral <b>OR</b> tasty <b>OR</b> disguisting berries<br>
<i>They are generally safe to consume, but affect mood. To know which berries they are, you will have to stock up on some of these berries and remember the following facts:</i><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • 4 or less disgusting berries are enough to drop your mood from excellent to good, or from good to neutral, or from neutral to bad, or from neutral to horrible<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • 4 or less tasy berries are enough to up your mood from horrible to bad, or from bad to neutral, or from neutral to good, or from good to excellent<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; • <b>fruit and bitterness</b> - it's poison berries with <b>cyanide</b> or <b>food poisoning</b>&nbsp;<b>OR</b> it's drug berries with <b>peyote</b>&nbsp;<b>OR</b> it's healing berries with <b>penicillin</b> or <b>opium</b><br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • prepare to heal toxins, you may fully heal toxins from one bite of dangerous berries with next ways:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • drink 10 units of tea (2 uses of tea leaves on liquid container)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • use leech 3 times<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • extract 2 times charcoal (10 units) with extraction kit and drink<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • if you ready to heal toxins, than bite berrie <b>ONE</b> time, if you taste:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • <b>strong flavor of fruit and the strong flavor of bitterness</b> - it's poison berries with <b>cyanide</b>. Start toxins healing right now!<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You will recieve messages: &#8243;Your body stings slightly&#8243;. Don't panic, just wait some after toxins healing.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • <b>strong flavor of fruit and bitterness</b> and receiving messages &#8243;You feel sick...&#8243; - it's poison berries with <b>food poisoning</b>. Start toxins healing right now!<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You may recieve messages: &#8243;Your body stings slightly&#8243;. Don't panic, just wait some after toxins healing.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • <b>strong flavor of fruit and bitterness</b> and you eyes fills with rainbow - it's drug berries with <b>peyote</b>. Don't panic, just wait some time, when effect ends.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • <b>fruit and the strong flavor of bitterness</b> - it's healing berries with <b>penicillin</b> or <b>opium</b>, wait some time, don't bite berrie, just wait about 3 minutes<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • if nothing happens - it's healing berries with <b>penicillin</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • if your character start shivers and you began recieve messages: &#8243;You feel slightly sick&#8243; - it's healing berries with <b>opium</b><br>

## Canned food

Any food product can be preserved in cans for long-term (infinite if sealed) storage. Canned food loses half satisfaction (or will be 1.5 times worse with negative satisfaction).<br><br>
There are 3 types of tin cans:<br>
<img src="assets/images/tin_can_small.png">can fit 3 food and fits in pocket,<br>
<img src="assets/images/tin_can.png">can fit 5 food,<br>
<img src="assets/images/tin_can_large.png">can fit 10 food.<br>
After filling it with food cans must be sealed at canner<img src="assets/images/canner.png">.<br>
<img src="assets/images/tools/boneknife.png">Cans can be opened with a knife. Attack the tin can with an empty hand to take the previously canned food.<br>

<small>Every time you put food in a tin can, it will lose satisfaction. Thus, putting food in a tin can and then taking it out and repeating it several times will result food item with very little satisfaction or terrible negative satisfaction.</small>

## How decay really works?

After creating a new food item, a food tick is triggered after 590-610 deciseconds. Each tick increases the decay timer by 600 (300 if the product not on the floor, 200 if it is in an unpowered fridge, 75 if it is on). If the container is a can, then the timer does not increase.

Food item that has a rotten variant, when the decay timer reaches more than half the time at the time the tick is checked, turns into its rotten version.

If the decay timer of a food item has exceeded its decay, then the item disappears.

Thus, for example, a raw cutlet, being in a refrigerator connected to the power supply, having 15 minutes before decays, will have 120 ticks (one minute each).

At the sixty-first tick, the cutlet will turn rotten. The minimum real time this will happen will be one hour minus one second (3599 seconds), the maximum time will be one hour, two minutes and one second (3721 seconds).
