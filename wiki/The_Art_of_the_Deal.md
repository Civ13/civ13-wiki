# The Art of the Deal
Welcome to **The Art of the Deal**, a game mode where you will need to
plan, negotiate, bribe, and backstab if you wish to become the winning
faction. This game mode has specific mechanics that you need to
familiarize with before playing, so read below - this article is not
very long.

## The Factions

There are four companies in the game mode:

  - **Goldstein Solutions**, known as the *yellow team*, with its base
    on the **North-West** part of the map. Phone number: **4444**
  - **MacGreene Traders**, known as the *green team*, with its base on
    the **South-West** part of the map. Phone number: **3333**
  - **Giovanni Blu**, known as the *blue team*, with its base on the
    **North-East** part of the map. Phone number: **2222**
  - **Rednikov Industries**, known as the *red team*, with its base on
    the **South-East** part of the map. Phone number: **1111**

In some rounds, **the Police** might be active. The Police station is
near the center of the map - see [The Art of the Deal\#The
Police](The_Art_of_the_Deal#The_Police "wikilink") for their specific
mechanics.

There are also **Paramedics**. They have a fully furnished hospital and
ambulances. **Be aware that killing a paramedic will greatly reduce your
faction's score!** Both the Police and Paramedics can be reached by
calling **911**.

## Companies

### The HQ

Each company headquarters features a meeting room, an armory/storage
room, a vault, a common area, and a garage. Below is a screenshot of the
Red Corporation's HQ - all others have a similar layout.

![Red HQ](assets/images/red_hq.png)

#### Meeting Room

This is where the team members spawn. Players should take some time
before the grace wall ends to plan their strategy. There is a wall map
that can be used to check which areas to go to.

#### Armory

At every company's HQ there is a storage room with equipment racks.
While the equipment is free, you will have to spend some of the company
money to buy weapons at the gun shop or on the DEEPNET.

#### Vault

The vault is where your team's starting disks are located. The vault is
where money should be deposited to keep it safe. Team leaders should
make sure the money is spent appropriately.

#### The Map

The map is divided into 10 columns from A to J, and 10 lines from 1 to
10. Each square has 22x22 tiles. You can check your current position on
the top of the screen, along with the coordinates. At the HQ, there is a
wall map that can be used for planning during the briefing: this map can
be drawn on. Players also spawn with a **portable map**.

![Minimap](assets/images/minimap.png)

### Radios and Phones

Each person spawns with a single-frequency **radio** tuned to that
factions frequency. It can be used to securely talk with fellow company
members.

**Company Telephones** can be used to contact 911 or other companies.
The numbers are pre-stored in the address book of the static phones at
the HQ.

### Computers

Each base has computers that can be used to access the black market
(DEEPNET), and to send e-mails to other companies. Each company has a
general e-mail, as below, but each member also has a personal e-mail.
When you login you can see all the personal and global e-mails.

| Company             | HQ Phone | Global E-mail     |
| ------------------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| Rednikov Industries | 1111     | mail@rednikov.ug  |
| MacGreene Traders   | 2222     | mail@greene.ug    |
| Giovanni Blu Stocks | 3333     | mail@blu.ug       |
| Goldstein Solutions | 4444     | mail@goldstein.ug |

### Disks

Each company starts with several **real** and **fake** disks. *Only the
company who produced the disk can check if it is real or not by
examining the disk.*

Disks also have active and inactive states - to activate a disk, you
need to put it next to another faction's disk, for example, during an
exchange. Disks can only be activated once. You can check if a disk is
active by examining it.

To read a disk, **put it into the computer at the HQ**. What you get for
it depends on three factors: 1) if the disk is real, 2) if it is active,
and 3) if it was exchanged (activated) with a real or fake disk.

Reading an **inactive disk**:

  - If **real**, you gain 100 dollars and 100 points.
  - If **fake**, you lose 100 points.

Reading an **active disk**:

|       |                           |                           |
| ----- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| A↓ B→ | Real                      | Fake                      |
| Real  | Both give 400$ & 400 pts  | Real gives 200$ & 200 pts |
| Fake  | Real gives 200$ & 200 pts | Both lose 200 pts         |

### Manufacturing

Each company has a factory area that can be used to produce electronic
**components**. They need a specific **precursor crystal** to produce
their faction-specific component, that must be acquired from other
company - They will also be able to order a precursor needed for another
company to manufacture their proprietary component. *The necessary
precursors will be randomized each round.*

To produce, use the crystals on the loader part of the machine and wait
about **1 minute**.

Example: **Yellow company** needs the **red precursor** to manufacture
the **yellow chip** this round. Only the **Red company** can order the
red precursor, so they will have to deal with them. Then they can sell
the chip to any company who needs it to fulfill a deal, as deals will
always require third party chips (**Yellow** will never get an order for
yellow chips)

The company will receive e-mails with orders for components regularly,
so be sure to check the desktop computer. Each order will feature a
**postbox location** where the products are to be delivered. The payment
will be delivered to the safe at the HQ.

**Precursors** can be ordered from the *E-LEKTRA* marketplace on each
desktop.

| Company | Precursor Needed    | Chip Produced   |
| ------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
| Red     | crimsonite crystals | RDKV S-445 chip |
| Green   | verdine crystals    | McGT S5R1 chip  |
| Yellow  | galdonium crystals  | GS-IC-M3 chip   |
| Blue    | indigon crystals    | GBSA-1994 chip  |

### Vehicles

Vehicles can be bought at the **car dealership** in the center. Be aware
that driving cars stolen from other companies will get you a warrant!

### Guns

There are two ways of acquiring guns - legal and illegal.

To get them **legally**, go to the Police Station with **100 dollars**
and use the terminal at the reception. You will need to have a clean
record. Then you can go to the gun shop at the center and buy them.

To get them **ilegally**, you will need to either buy them from another
company, get someone to buy them for you, or find a black market vendor.
Be aware that unregistered **guns with their numbers filed out are
illegal to possess even if you have a gun permit.**

### Citizen's Arrest

You can arrest a member of another company who has a pending warrant.
Bring him handcuffed/roped to the station and use the terminal in the
reception. You will get paid **100 dollars**.

## The Police

The police is in charge of making sure everyone follows the law. Check
[The Art of the Deal\#Rules](The_Art_of_the_Deal#Rules "wikilink") for
which laws can be enforced.

### The Station

![Police Station](assets/images/police_station.png)

#### Main Room

This is where the team members spawn. Players should take some time
before the grace wall ends to plan their strategy. There is a wall map
that can be used to check which ares to go to, and a 911 terminal where
you can receive calls from the factions.

#### Armory

The Police armory has plenty of equipment available for free for all the
members of the force. Other factions can't access the lockers.

#### Evidence Room

This is where the Police should keep apprehended money, guns, and disks.
They will count towards the score as long as they're there.

#### Jail

If the police manage to arrest a faction member, they should be brought
here. Sit them in the bench next to the terminal, and use it to check
for warrants. If the suspect has pending warrants, it will automatically
clear them and give the Police points, so they can be released.

#### Garage

The Police Department has 2 starting police interceptors across the
street.

#### The Map

See [The Art of the Deal\#The
Map](The_Art_of_the_Deal#The_Map "wikilink").

### Radios

Police radios are single-frequency and encrypted, meaning that other
factions cannot listen to police communications unless they manage to
get one of their radios.

### Police Codes

As an officer, you can use police codes for fast broadcasting. It will
be automatically converted to plaintext. Just use the radio prefix
followed by the code, for example, **";10-4"** for affirmative.

| Code | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

### Going Undercover

As a police officer, you can go undercover by switching into civilian
clothes (available at the armory) and **toggling the undercover mode
under the IC tab**. Make sure to bring your badge, tough.

## Objectives and Rules

Each faction has different objectives that will count towards the score.

### Companies

Each company must acquire as much money as possible. Dead members will
reduce the score. Money must be stored in the safe. To see how the disk
conversion to money works, check [The Art of the
Deal\#Disks](The_Art_of_the_Deal#Disks "wikilink"). Attacking Police
Officers *should be avoided at all costs*, as it will reduce the
company's points and give the police reason to search the HQ!

**Score Values:**

|                       |           |
| --------------------- | --------- |
| Money                 | 1$ = 1 pt |
| Dead Members          | \-100 pts |
| Killed Police Officer | \-250 pts |
| Killed Paramedic      | \-500 pts |

### Police

The police get points for arresting company members and bringing them to
jail at the police station. They will lose points for every officer
killed. Apprehended disks and money also count towards the score, and
should be kept in the **Evidence Room**.

#### Rules

The police has the right to stop and search any person or vehicle, with
or without suspicion, including setting up road blocks to search all
traffic coming through. Company's properties are exempt from this rule,
as *a search can only be conducted if there is a warrant*, which only
happens if a member of the company has harmed a police officer.

A police officer may use **lethal force** if the suspect:

  - is discharging a firearm towards another person;
  - attempts to fire at, run over, or physically harm a police officer;
  - is armed and refuses to disarm, or be disarmed, upon request by an
    officer.

A police officer may **arrest** a suspect if they:

  - are openly carrying firearms, explosives, silencers, or are found to
    be in possession of them while being searched;
  - are in possession of a disk of any company, even their own;
  - are trespassing another company's property, as confirmed by a member
    of that company;
  - are trespassing inside the police station restricted area (anything
    after the reception);
  - are in possession of police equipment, including armor, firearms,
    and radios;
  - have a pending arrest warrant;
  - are resisting or refusing being searched by an officer. This also
    applies to vehicles. For properties, a warrant is needed.

The following items can be **confiscated, without an arrest being
necessary**:

  - a vehicle being driven by a member of another faction, if claimed as
    stolen by the owner;
  - possession of more than 500$ in cash.

Suspects may be **bailed from Jail** for a fee of **500$**, to be
delivered in cash at the station.

Breaking the above rules will give penalties to the score, at the
discretion of an admin.

**Score Values:**

|                           |            |
| ------------------------- | ---------- |
| Company's Disks           | 300 pts    |
| Processed Warrants        | 300 pts    |
| Citizen's Arrest Warrants | 100 pts    |
| Money                     | 1$ = 1 pts |
| Dead Officers             | \-150 pts  |

## Round Example

The Red team contacts all the other teams to sell their disk. Green and
Blue are interested. Blue offers more money, so they decide to go with
them; however, Red decides to double-cross the Green team, scheduling a
meeting near the gas station and warning the police about it.

Blue and Red successfully trade a disk for 400$. Meanwhile, the police
show up and manage to arrest one of the green company members, while the
rest of the team gets away.

The Green team contacts the Police in order to bail out their member:
They offer 350$. The Police accept and both schedule a meeting to
deliver the money. However, the green team takes advantage of the
situation while the police station is left practically unguarded and
launches an assault to free their team member.
