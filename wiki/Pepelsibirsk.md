# The City of Pepelsibirsk
Welcome to Pepelsibirsk, a humble city in the northern Urals. The weather is cold and drab - certainly no tropical resort!  
The year is 1976. The Soviet central government has collapsed following a limited nuclear exchange with the United States. The city must govern itself, trading with neighbouring settlements and remaining military installations to guarantee its continued survival and security.

This map has special mechanics and is designed for a specific type of realistic roleplay, so I would highly recommend reading (or better yet - keeping on-hand) the following guide. It is useful for prospective rulers, government ministers, tyrants, rebels, criminals, businessmen, and even common citizens.

# Politics
*These are just RP suggestions - feel free to come up with your own system of government. Note, however, that the following wiki is written with the historical system in mind.*

### Historical
Historically, the Soviet government operated using a theoretically "bottom-up" system, in which local Soviets (councils) elected by industrial, agricultural, and military personnel sent delegates to regional Soviets, eventually going all the way up to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, or, earlier, the Congress of Soviets. Candidates in these elections were required approval by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and elections were not competitive - you could merely vote for or against a candidate, the latter only being successful in isolated cases. Factionalism was banned (theoretically an emergency measure enacted in 1921, but this ban on factions remained until 1989) and Soviets were always expected to vote unanimously, resulting in minimal diversity of opinion and the Soviets being reduced to a de-facto rubber stamp for the bureaucratized CPSU.

This system can be implemented on a smaller scale in Pepelsibirsk, using the City Soviet as a stand-in for the Supreme Soviet, with the city's ruler being Chairman of the Communist Party of Pepelsibirsk (or whatever you choose to call it).

### Soviet Democracy
This is similar to the historical system, but without the ban on factionalism and competitive elections within the Soviets. This is similar to the system initially implemented at the start of the October Revolution, and can be considered a form of semi-direct democracy.

### Anarchism
Another socialist system, anarchism in this guide is represented as a more decentralized form of Soviet Democracy. The state is minimal, with all decisions made democratically by the Soviets. Civil liberties are absolute, and legal punishments are minimized as much as possible. The power of the Supreme Soviet is reduced to only military and diplomatic affairs. Economically, money is either abolished or reduced in importance, and all businesses are operated as community-run cooperatives - the factory worker runs the factory, the farmer runs the farm, and the soldier runs the brigade. Even in the army, soldiers are expected to elect their officer.

### Parliamentary Republic
In a parliamentary republic, an elected parliament runs the state, typically with a Chancellor or Prime Minister chosen to be the head of government (and de-facto head of state). It is a non-socialist system of government, and does not make use of workplace democracy, typically preferring simple multi-party elections.

### Directorial Republic
In a directorial republic, multiple people serve as Head of State and sometimes Head of Government, typically operating alongside an elected parliament, though not always. This system can be combined with either socialist or non-socialist systems; historically, the Soviet Union used a similar system of "Collective Leadership" in which multiple people had near-equal power in the CPSU, particularly during the Brezhnev era. Switzerland uses this system as well, as did the Roman Republic and the French Directory and Consulate.

### Presidential Republic

# Ministries

The following buildings/compounds/factories may need managers assigned at the start of the game:
- In the far east of the map, there is a combined prison/police station. This may be effectively used to suppress and contain *hardened criminals*.
- Just south of the city Soviet is located a hospital, well-equipped to deal with the injuries naturally caused whilst preserving the legacy of October.
- In the center of the map is a warehouse, equipped with the latest advances in *☭Soviet Superscience☭*, allowing you to easily view its complete contents. Use this to assist in resource allocation and planning.
- In the northeast of the map is a large mine and steel mill, which can be used to extract minerals and clay for both domestic use and export.
