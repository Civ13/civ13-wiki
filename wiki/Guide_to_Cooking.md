# Guide to Cooking

## Why cook?

Cooking is useful for making meat and water safe to consume, as well as
increasing the nutrition value of every other non-meat food, like
vegetables and wheat-derived products.

Furthermore, more complex recipes are also even more nutritious and improve **[mood](Starter_Guide#mood)**. Besides, this also presents interesting RP options, such as being vegetarian, perhaps pork-free, et cetera, some of which could be enforced with selectable **[traits](Guide_to_Character#traits)**.

## Kitchen implements

See the **[Full Crafting List](Full_Crafting_List)** for more details about crafting the implements from the list.

## Food storage

~~Store in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight.~~

Most foods will spoil and decay (read, vanish from existence) if left in the open. Some preserved, as well as canned food are an exception and will last as long the world does (until the end of the round). Scattered food may also attract pests, such as mice.

Finding a formerly bursting-at-the-seams pantry devoid of its delicious contents may very well reduce a hungry soul to tears. Fortunately, there are ways to extend the shelf life of your food stock, which boil down to storing food inside any crate or a fridge.

Check **[here](Food_Decay_Times)** for the decay times for different **unstored** foods.

**Meat and fish products also rot! It takes half the time of full decay!** Meaning, it takes a meat slab 15 minutes to decay, but it will become rotten after 7.5 minutes.

Decay time for the food stored in a **crate** is **doubled**.

Decay time for the food stored in a **fridge** is **tripled**. **A fridge must be [connected](Guide_to_Crafting#wiring) to a [power source](Guide_to_Crafting#engines) to work!**

## Campfire, Oven and Wood Stove

Campfires and ovens can be used to roast food and prepare advanced
recipes, as well as to boil water for safe consumption and burn down
any uncookable item into a burned mess (disappears after a while).

You can roast plenty of things: vegetables, meat, fish etc.

  - Make a campfire with wood, an oven with iron, or a wood stove with
    steel. A campfire can cook two items at a time, whereas an oven can
    cook three at a time, and the best being the wood stove which can
    cook four items at a time which is the best way to save fuel. Oven and stove also cook much faster.
  - Put some fuel inside (wood or coal, for instance).
  - Place food or container filled with water to boil.
  - Wait for it to finish cooking/boiling.
  - Eat!

A more detailed section on campfires and ovens could be found **[here](Guide_to_Crafting#campfire-iron-oven-and-wood-stove)**.

## Ingredients

All great dishes require ingredients! Here you will find the
ingredients needed to make your fantastic dishes, uma delicia!

**Numbers in the steps description mean there is more than one way to make something ("1" is one way, "2" - another, etc.)**

## Canning

Canning is a good way to preserve food for later consumption.

<img src="assets/images/tin_can_large.png"><img src="assets/images/tin_can.png"><img src="assets/images/tin_can_small.png">

* Make tin cans with tin. Large cans hold 10 units, regular - 5, small - 3 units. 1 food item = 1 unit.
* Fill cans with whatever food.
* Seal cans with the canner, entering a brand name and selecting colours for the can's design.
* When the time comes, open sealed cans with a knife, then click them with an empty hand to remove food.
* Used cans could be recycled back into tin with the **[furnace](Guide_to_Crafting#furnace)**.
