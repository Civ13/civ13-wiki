# Guide to Construction

Construction requires basic knowledge in other areas, such as resource acquirement, which are covered in the **[Guide to Crafting](Guide_to_Crafting)**.

It is truly a marvel, that from this dusty dirt under our feet, these
heaps of rugged stones and those chaotically growing trees could spring
such smooth, even walls in all their rectangular glory. A natural
landscape is a wild beast that needs to be reined in, and reined in it
will be!
<hr>
There are a few key elements in the area of construction that you could
combine and rearrange as you see fit to raise buildings, lay roads and
develop infrastructure as a whole that is both functional and pleasing
to the eye. These elements are walls, floors, doors, windows, roofs and
barricades along with fences. There are also somewhat distinct
categories of fortifications and lighting.

**To look for specific items, use the “Find in page” command - Ctrl-F.**

## Construction orientation

**Mind that the orientation of some constructions depends on the
direction your character is facing!** For example, some walls are built
vertically if you are facing North or South, or horizontally, if you are
facing East or West. Some wall types also have separate corner elements
for better appearance. All of this is marked in the description of a
specific construction. **N, S, W, E** mean you need to be facing either
North, South, West and East to build a wall the same as the image;
**All** means the construction will look the same regardless of the
direction.

<b>Some wall tiles change their appearance depending on neighbouring
walls of the same type, so they connect seamlessly to each other.</b>
These walls are marked as **Adaptive**.

## Construction materials

A few more details about particular materials.

### Clay

**[Clay](Full_Crafting_List#clay)** is obtained from **[dirt](Guide_to_Crafting#soil)**:

- Dig any dirt tiles with a shovel to get dirt piles.

- Fill a container (a bucket, a barrel etc.) with water, then click dirt piles with it.

- 10 units of water + 1 dirt pile = 1 clay

### Bricks

Most bricks and blocks are made with **[Clay](Full_Crafting_List#clay)**, except for stone bricks.

  - First, make batches of unfired bricks.

  - Put the unfired bricks in either **[a campfire, an oven or a stove](Guide_to_Crafting#campfire-iron-oven-and-wood-stove)**.

  - Cook until done.

**Hover the mouse cursor over the icon to see the material cost.**

## Walls

<b>Deconstruction</b>

Any kind of wood walls could be set on fire by hitting them with a
torch. A wall will burn down in a few minutes, destroying the roof tiles
supported by the wall as well (more in the
**[Roofs](#roofs "wikilink")** section). **Remove the grass and the wood floor around the wall if you are going to burn it!** Otherwise the fire
will very likely spread from the burning wall.

Another way is simple brute force - hit a wall with melee weapons, and
it will go down sooner or later. Stone walls, the strongest ones, take
around 100 hits to bring down, or fewer if your strength is high and you
apply a weapon with high damage.

<u><b>Straw</b></u>

Made with 4 wood logs. Very primitive, but it still provides shelter, if
a flimsy one.

## Roofs

Roofs provide shelter from bad weather, e.g. rains, blizzards and
sandstorms, as well as a nice cool shade.

Roofs are supported by walls, wooden roof supports and stone pillars and
columns. ***Wooden mine supports do not hold the buildable roof!***

The image below shows the roof area supported by either a roof support

the same area.)

<img src="assets/images/roof_area.png">

There is a variety of roofs to build from different materials (see below - hover the mouse cursor over a roof builder's icon to see the cost and
the material). Roof icons are adaptive, similarly to some of the walls,
so they change their appearance, depending on the roof in neighbouring
tiles.

**To construct a roof, take a respective roof builder and either click
it in your hand, or press Ctrl-Z or Z in the hotkeys mode.** A roof tile
will be constructed in the tile in front of you, the one you are facing,
if there is a suitable support nearby.

**To deconstruct a roof, click it with the hammer.** Either stand
outside the roof, so you can see it, or hold Alt and click the tile with
the roof. An additional "Turf" tab will appear in the upper right corner - click the roof there with the hammer in the active hand.

**If roof supports are removed with the roof still present, the roof
will collapse! Collapsing roof may severely injure and even kill those
in the roofed area, or even standing next to it.**

## Floors

No more sloshing or plodding through the mud and snow! Walk the
civilized way, swiftly and with resonant "top-top" footfalls! Not only
that - floors on the surface prevent digging upwards from the
underground. **Floors can be removed with the hammer.**

<u><b>Barricades</b></u>

**Dirt and snow** - take a pile of respective material in your hand and
click one of the tiles next to the tile you are standing on. This will
start building a barricade at the adjacent tile. Add 3 more piles to
finish it.

**Rock** - crafted with 3 stone.

**Sandbag** - make sandbags with
**[Cloth](Full_Crafting_List#cloth "wikilink")**, then build the barricade like a dirt/snow one.

**All barricades could be dismantled by clicking them with an empty
hand.**

<b>Barricades provide some protection from ranged attacks when you stand
right next to and behind them.</b>

## Fortifications

## Lighting
It is not a proper Civilization until you can see city lights from space!

Electric lights need to be **[connected](Guide_to_Crafting#wiring)** to an **[engine](Guide_to_Crafting#engines)** to work. **While connecting an electric light to a cable, do not stand on the same tile where the light is. Stand on a neighbouring tile where there is cable on the floor and click the light with the cable coil. This will connect the light to the cable on the floor.**

Remember to restart the engine to power newly connected lights to the existing power network.
