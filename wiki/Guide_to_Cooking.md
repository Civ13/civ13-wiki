# Guide to Cooking

## Why cook?

Cooking is useful for making meat and water safe to consume, as well as
increasing the nutrition value of every other non-meat food, like
vegetables and wheat-derived products.

Furthermore, more complex recipes are also even more nutritious, and
also present interesting RP options, such as being vegetarian, perhaps
pork-free, etcetera.

## Campfire/Oven/Wood Stove

Campfires and ovens can be used to roast food and prepare advanced
recipes, as well as boiling water for safe consumption, and burning down
any item into a Burned Mess.

  - Make a campfire with wood, an oven with iron, or a wood stove with
    steel. A campfire can cook two items at a time, whereas an oven can
    cook three at a time, and the best being the wood stove which can
    cook five items at a time which is the best way to save fuel.
  - Put some fuel inside, if needed (wood or coal).
  - Place food (or container filled with water to boil).
  - Wait for it to finish cooking/boiling.
  - Eat!

## Cooking Pot

You can make a cooking pot to make a stew. The advantage of this method
is that you can get rid of thirstiness and hunger at the same time, so
long as you don't cook with salty water or dried meat, as those will
contain salt, and dehydrate you. Another benefit is the fact that
cooking pot will never go stale or decompose, allowing you to store food
indefinitely! NOTE: Filled wooden bowls will become stale and
decomposed if not eaten.

## Fridge

You can keep food fresh and safe to eat by putting them in a fridge. The
fridge needs to be powered to keep the food inside it safe to eat
