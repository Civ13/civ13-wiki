# Guide to Medical

On round types that have specified doctors or surgeon jobs please only
join these roles if you have had prior experience with Civilization 13
medical on other rounds, as they are limited and many people will be
relying on you to act fast.

## First-Aid

- The first thing you need to do is drag them (quickly hold CTRL then
click, or right-click then select Pull) away from wildlife or people
chasing/shooting them before they get finished off.

- SHIFT+click or right-click Examine at the person to look more closely
at them, you might see where the bleeding is, but you should ask them as
well as they can tell you about anything that is covered up (if they
don't know how you can use
<span style="font-family:Fixedsys;">LOOC</span> chat to tell them that
they need to click on their face icon on the right side of the screen).
If you have a doctor's handbook you can use that on them to get fastest
details for triage.

- Bandage or trauma-kit any bleeding as top priority, and get them
buckled to a bed which will also help them stabilize. Don't take them
any further than the closest bed unless you have to, and tell them to
stay buckled to the bed and not try walking/crawling as moving around
more with broken bones does more damage. Food and water help healing
too, but do not stuff them full of dried meat as the salt in it can
overdose and do more damage to an already near-death person, so fresh
food is better.

- After main bleeds are stopped, the most injured body parts might also
have internal bleeding, which is important to fix as soon as you can,
but you should not operate while they are "incredibly wounded" when you
SHIFT+click or right-click Examine at them and let bed rest and food
make them slightly safer to operate on first as there's a chance to make
mistakes and do damage. If your character does slip up due to lack of
experience in medicine, poor tools or bad luck, examine them, and
depending on how close to death you might need to stop operating,
cauterise the opened (bleeding) wound and then bandage any bleeding you
caused.

- If doctor's handbooks haven't been invented yet you're going to need
to open this person up and check inside each body part (at bottom-right)
that was bleeding with your bare hands like a true blood-covered
witch-doctor/chiurgeon. Anyone can use [proper tools that get invented
later](#Surgery "wikilink"), but in dire situations if your character
has had some previous experience in medicine (*Character tab at the
top-right, Medical [skill](Skills "wikilink")

- You can advance with
practice or reading scientific stone slates/papyrus/books*) you will be
able to fix internal bleeding with a simple knife to open an incision,
hemp rope to clamp, wood handle to retract the skin, hemp rope again to
tie the bleeding vein inside, and a burning torch to cauterise to close
the incision back up again. You can fix broken bones with a wooden
hammer or bone-setter after fixing veins but this is not advised if they
are heavily wounded as the steps can fail and do damage when your top
priority is getting the internal bleeding stopped first, and there might
still be other body parts that have internal bleeding you haven't
checked yet. If the chest is one of the body parts do that first and
also try to bandage the heart just in case after the first incision, or
if doing separately after fixing internal bleeding, simply cauterise
again afterwards. Then try do the same for the brain which will also
help with blurry eyes. You can RP this in ancient times as healing
salves and ointments being applied, some of which might have been later
forgotten by history.

- Now you have a person that will stay alive as long as they don't move.
The next step is to check for any broken parts missed, as when someone
moves with broken bones it will do them damage unless it is Splinted
(which is only a temporary fix). Moving with broken skulls leads to
blindness, brain damage and pain paralysis that will lead to eventual
death from starvation/thirst, cold snow or rain, hot sandstorms or other
hazards.

- In the absence of a doctor's handbook, to check body parts for broken
bones click the yellow button at the bottom-right to go into Grab mode,
click them, then double-click the Grab icon that appears in your hands
in the bottom-middle of the screen to double it up and turn it into an
"aggressive" grab - then change to green/help mode and click on the
person with the body part you want to check selected at bottom-right,
and the chat box will start telling you what your fingers find there.
Now [read about Surgery here](#Surgery "wikilink"), remind them not to
start walking around again straight after while seriously wounded or the
bone will just break again, they need to stay in bed and heal up before
leaving (again, food and water helps with this). This time is a good
opportunity to talk about the causes of the wound or illness and to get
to know your patient.

### Physical Healing

#### Bleeding

**Healing Herbs:** Mostly used by primitive peoples, it will not help
stop the bleeding but will also clean the wound, so it is always
preferable. can be gathered from bushes with a knife.

**Bandages:** Quick and effective, most people should carry some all
times, reduces the pain on most wounds and helps to treat bleeding as
well.

**Splints:** A quick and easy solution to broken bones, will help to
stabilize the victim until surgery.

#### Stimulants, pain relievers and cleansing agents.

**Tea:** Tea heals toxins and helps fight drowsiness and
hallucinations! Cure for flu.

**Charcoal:** Charcoal heals toxins very effectively, slight anti-rad,
but does not help with drowsiness and hallucinations.

**Leech:** Drains toxins and bloods from patients, good alternative to

lot when patients are mostly suffering from pain.

**Potassium Iodide:** Heals radiation. Cure for zombie virus.

**Penicillin:** Cure for typhus

### Advanced

**Trauma Kit:** Probably the Most useful and effective medical supply,
this specialized kit for trauma wounds will take care of most of the
wounds, stopping pain. Also used in Surgeries to repair Organ Damage.

**Burn Kit:** Mostly used to treat burn wounds, but can also help heal
the area.

## Continued Care

Without proper care, individuals may end up ill or even worse.

### Diseases

There are currently 5 diseases. Try not to catch them, they will make
your day a whole lot more miserable. Especially in early game, when
advanced medicine doesn't exist.

#### Plague

The rarest and the most lethal disease. If you have it, you will
probably die.

  - Caught from eating raw mice. Or standing too long near one.
  - Transmits from person to person.
  - It can be spotted by the lumps on your skin and vomiting blood.
  - If you survive, you will get immunity.

#### Malaria

A deadly disease caused by parasites.

  - Transmitted by mosquitoes.
  - Does not transmit from person to person.
  - Will give you very high fevers with shivering and convulsions.
  - Untreated, it will give you brain damage from the fever, and
    possibly kill you.
  - Normally survivable without treatment, but won't give you immunity.
  - Damage can be greatly reduced by taking quinine (harvested from the
    Chinchona plant).
  - You will not get immunity.

#### Cholera

A disease caused by water-borne bacteria.

  - Caught by drinking straight from puddles or water tiles without
    boiling it first.
  - Cannot be transmitted in any way.
  - Will cause you to convulse and vomit. This will dehydrate you fast\!

#### Flu

Just a normal flu.

  - Caught from being dirty.

    contaminate an entire village!
  - Will very probably not kill you, but can be an annoyance, causing
    blurred vision, blackouts, and fever.
  - Untreated flu might give you brain damage from high fever.
  - Manageable by eating and drinking until full, and resting (buckling
    to a bed).
  - Brain damage can be prevented by drinking plenty of tea until the
    fever subsides.
  - You might get immunity after surviving it.

#### Typhus

You've been covered with lice for days and now you feel sick.

  - You might get it from wearing dirty clothes for too long. Watch out for the flea sprites.
  - Throwing up randomly.
  - Slightly transmittable from person to person.
  - Untreated typhus will lead to your death.
  - Treatment is through penicillin and tea.
  - You might get immunity after surviving it.

### Combating Illness

If you are a medical professional or just a beginner you may wish to
learn how to keep people from ending up sick and useless.

  
- **Salt overdose**: Extreme dehydration from drinking sea-water (even
    boiled) or eating too much dried meat 
- you might be able to save
    them by feeding them with a lot of water, and if you have tea that
    will help too.
  
- **Cholera**: Extreme dehydration and vomiting from drinking puddle/
    river water (or a Well with fecies near it) that hasn't had the
    germs cooked out of it. Give them lots of clean water and cooked
    food.
  
- **Food poisoning**: Cooked food, clean water and healing tea.
  
- **Flu:** Causes victims to suffer from weakness or even fever,
    fevers will worsen depending on certain factors, weather and
    fullness. The flu can be cured, it can also cause people to become
    immune to it if they are sick enough.
  
- **Plague:** Take Infected individuals away from large groups, burn
    Infected Corpses and burry them far away.
