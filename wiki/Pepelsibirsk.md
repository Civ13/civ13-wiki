# Pepelsibirsk
Welcome to Pepelsibirsk, a humble city in the northern Urals. The year is 1976, and the Soviet central government has collapsed following a limited nuclear exchange. The city must govern itself, trading
with neighbouring settlements and remaining military installations to guarantee its continued survival and security.

# Politics
*This is just an RP suggestion - feel free to come up with your own system of government. Note, however, that the following wiki is written with this system in mind.*


# Government

The following buildings/compounds/factories may need managers assigned at the start of the game:
- In the far east of the map, there is a combined prison/police station. This may be effectively used to suppress and contain *hardened criminals*.
- Just south of the city Soviet is located a hospital, well-equipped to deal with the injuries naturally caused whilst preserving the legacy of October.
