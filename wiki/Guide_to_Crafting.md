# Guide to Crafting
<p><strong><em>"Engineering is the art of directing the great sources of power in nature for the use and convenience of man."</em></strong><br />
Thomas Tredgold</p>


Have you ever thought of dedicating your life to something meaningful?
Well, you have found the guide to it\! Once you familiarize yourself
with these notes on crafting, you will have learned enough to become a
true artisan, a person who is instrumental in lifting your Civilization
from the primitive ways of loincloths, caves and wooden clubs to the
dizzying complexities of electrified cities, wireless communications and
automatic firearms.

Here you will find the basics of how crafting works, along with the
information on resource acquirement, tools, various workbenches,
machinery and vehicles.

**Be sure to consult the following pages:**

  - **[Full Crafting List](Full_Crafting_List "wikilink")** - contains
    the list of materials and detailed crafting recipes for most of the
    craftable items, save for those that require specific machinery or a
    workbench, such as anvil, bakelizer, gunsmithing bench etc.
  - **[Guide to Farming](Guide_to_Farming "wikilink")** - includes the
    list of the agricultural produce, of which
    **[cotton](Full_Crafting_List#cloth "wikilink")**,
    **[trees](Full_Crafting_List#wood "wikilink")**, and
    **[hemp](Full_Crafting_List#rope "wikilink")** are of particular
    importance for crafting.
  - **[Guide to Ranching](Guide_to_Ranching "wikilink")** - includes the
    list of animals, many of which provide various materials for
    crafting.

## Basics

  - Have some material in your active hand
  - Click the material, or press Ctrl-Z or simply Z, if you have toggled
    the hotkeys mode on.

This will bring up the crafting menu for a given material - a list of
recipes for the items that can be made with this material at the present
moment. **Many recipes require a certain research level, otherwise they
will not be available\!** Check the **[Full Crafting
List](Full_Crafting_List "wikilink")** for an item's research
requirements. If you belong to a faction, you can see the current
research levels on the Character tab. If you are not a part of a
faction, checking the current epoch on the Status tab will give you a
general idea about the available recipes.

Some recipes also become obsolete over time and, consequently, are
removed from the list in the later epochs.

While most items are made with just one material, some recipes require
having a second material or a specific item in your non-active hand (for
example, crafting a bone shovel needs bones and a wooden handle). In
this case you will get a message if you are missing the required
component.

### Skill

Crafting anything increases your crafting skill which is displayed on
the Character tab. Some recipes and workbenches require a certain level
of the crafting skill, the former to craft an item and the latter to use
them. For example, building a well or a wall requires the skill at the
1.1 mark, while using an anvil requires 1.7. See the **[Full Crafting
List](Full_Crafting_List "wikilink")** for the skill requirements for a
given recipe.

### Crafting differences between gamemodes

Different gamemodes may limit crafting options in some ways. For
instance, in the Tribes mode, the research level for each race is
locked, and the list of available recipes does not change, thus only
Humans and Orcs can make and use the anvil.

Certain crafting options may also be restricted to certain professions.
For example, in the RP maps like **[Colony](Colony "wikilink")** and
Pioneers, only the Blacksmith can use the anvil.

## Resources

As you look upon the sunny fields, bordered by a lush green forest, or
upon the scorched desert dunes and steep snow-capped mountains, a warm
feeling comes over you - you cannot help but wonder at the abundance of
so many resources ripe for the taking, processing and exploiting. Ah,
sweet industry\!

If there are any recipes associated with a given material, the material
name has a link - click it to see the recipes list in the **[Full
Crafting List](Full_Crafting_List "wikilink")**. If there is no such
link, it means the material does not have a crafting menu of its own,
but it is still used as a component in some other area of crafting.

### Wood

There are two main ways to obtain
**[Wood](Full_Crafting_List#wood "wikilink")** for crafting:

  - **Cut down trees in the wilderness** - preferably, a hatchet should
    be used, but a knife works too, although it will take around 15-20
    hits to fell a tree. Depending on the tree, the yield is 3-7 wood
    logs. However, avoid using knives to cut down palms - it will take
    much more effort to cut the trunk of these desert-hardened trees.
    Trees will grow back slowly.

### Soil

This group includes the kinds of soil that could be used as materials.
First, you need a shovel - click the ground with it to dig. You may need
to remove the grass with a plough first or shovel the snow away (on
permafrost tiles the dirt could never be exposed). Farming fields could
also be dug. There is a limit to how many times you could dig a single
tile.

When you have piles of dirt or snow, you can use them right away to
build barricades and walls. Refer to the
**[Construction](#Construction "wikilink")** section for more details.

### Ores

The riches that have been accumulating for eons, concealed by mass of
rock. Time to hollow out the earth and put them to good use\!

**Smelting**
Some ores must be processed before crafting, which is done by smelting
them in **[Campfire, Ovens and
Furnace](#Campfire,_Ovens_and_Furnace "wikilink")**. See that section
for the detailed description of smelting and available alloys. Smelting
ores produces ingots, which are a material that could be used for
crafting.

**Obsidian** is turned into usable material sheets by cutting it with
hammer and chisel - click a stack of obsidian rocks with a chisel while
holding a hammer in the other hand.

**Additional information**

  - **Uranium is radioactive\!** It will slowly irradiate everything in
    the vicinity if left out in the open.
  - The ore yielded from excavation is purely random; some ores appear
    noticeably rarer than others. Among the rarest ores are diamonds,
    coal, saltpeter, sulfur and uranium. Lead, mercury and platinum are
    also somewhat uncommon.
  - Ores marked with (\*) could be found only in the undergrounds of
    certain biomes:

#### <big>Mining</big>

<center>
<p><strong>Safety first!</strong></p>
</center></td>
<td></td>
<td><p>Mining is pretty straightforward, save for one nuance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dig an underground entrance (a tunnel) - have a shovel in the active hand and click it, or press Ctrl-Z or Z in the hotkeys mode, then choose the respective option. A tunnel could be removed by filling it with dirt piles.</li>
<li>Click the entrance to go down.</li>
<li><strong>Build a mining support!</strong> It could be either a wooden mining support or a stone pillar, both work the same.</li>
<li>Proceed to hack away at the rock.</li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Now about that nuance, which has to do with how supports work. **Stay
within two tiles of a nearest mining support to avoid a cave-in\!** Look
at the picture - the lantern on the ground marks the maximum safe
distance at which you can stand and mine everything in your reach. Even
though supports technically hold 3 tiles of the ceiling, if you stand on
a tile and there are 2 tiles between you and the closest support, a
cave-in is likely to happen. Back to the picture - **if you so much as
stood on the rightmost tile, where there is no support, it could result
in a cave-in** (it is not guaranteed to happen, but the probability is
high.)

There are two kinds of cave-ins, a minor and a major one, and there is
an element of chance as to which cave-in befalls a careless miner. A
minor cave-in is more likely to happen at first - a few rocks would fall
and leave you with a couple of bruises or a bleeding at worst. But the
more you stay at or try to enter the dangerous spot, the higher the risk
of a major cave-in, which will literally bury you under the piles of
rock, trapping you and possibly breaking some bones. And you better have
either wood or stone at hand to make a support, otherwise you are stuck
for good. You could scream, of course - someone just might hear you...

Finally, you do not always have to go underground to mine. The rock
tiles suitable for mining could also be found on the surface, sometimes
covering a large area (they are still named 'underground rock', though.)
Be mindful, that, if you start mining and the ground under the excavated
rock walls appears darkened compared to the outside, it means the darker
area is considered a cave and you need to place supports there to
prevent cave-ins, just like underground.

And do not forget the ore collector\!

**Additional information**

  - Crude oil could be distilled and processed into a number of
    petroleum products. See the **[Machinery](#Machinery "wikilink")**
    section for more information on the respective equipment. However,
    crude oil could be used directly to fuel one of the more primitive
    engines - the hot bulb engine.
  - Petroleum as fuel for lamps, lanterns and the hot bulb engine could
    be substituted with **[olive oil](Guide_to_Farming "wikilink")**.

## Campfire, Ovens and Furnace

The means to harness fire.

### Fuel

To keep the flames burning, you need fuel, and for that you can use
either wood, tree branches, mineral coal or charcoal.

**Pay attention when adding fuel to your fires, so as not to
accidentally feed it a whole stack of 50 pieces of coal (unless that is
your intent, of course)\! Fuel cannot be retrieved\!** Shift-Click the
stack to examine the quantity, then separate the stack by holding it in
the non-active hand and clicking it with the active empty hand.

Here is how long 1 unit of different fuel will last (minutes):

Wood - 1
Branches - 1
Coal - 3
Charcoal - 1

### Operating manual

  - Take something that you intend to put in the campfire, oven etc.
    (food item, ore, fuel.)
  - Click the campfire, oven etc. with it. Fuel is spent irretrievably,
    while everything else is put 'inside' or 'in the fire' and could be
    ejected by right-clicking a campfire or an oven and choosing 'Empty'
    command. The number of items that could fit inside is termed
    'capacity' (see more in the next subsection.) One stack is
    considered a single item. Pots do not go inside, they are
    'physically' put onto the campfire or the oven itself.
  - Click the campfire, oven etc. again to light the fire. You can also
    add more items to be cooked while there is fire.
  - After a while a product will be ready - cooked food, metal ingots,
    glass sheets etc. Unless, of course, it was something unsuitable, in
    which case it will turn into burned mess which you can only throw
    away.
  - Click the campfire, oven etc. to put out the fire, or leave it
    burning for light.

### Campfire, iron oven and wood stove

Essentially, these three have the same functions - to smelt ores into
metal ingots, to fire pottery and bricks of
**[Clay](Full_Crafting_List#clay "wikilink")**, and to
**[cook](Guide_to_Cooking "wikilink")**. There are two main differences
between a campfire, an oven and a stove. The first one is their
capacity, i.e. the number of objects they can hold and process
simultaneously. You can think about it as a number of 'production
slots'. The second one is the time it takes to cook something in the
fire - advanced ovens and stoves are much faster at it than the
campfire.

### Furnace

The furnace has a different purpose. It is used to produce steel sheets
from iron, to alloy metals and to recycle some of the metallic items
back into metal ingots for further use. It is operated similarly to the
campfires and ovens, apart from that it does not have continuous fire -
the fire will go out after an operation is finished. The furnace
requires 2 units of fuel per single operation, i.e. at least 2 wood logs
or 1 piece of mineral coal.

**Available alloys**

Furnace accepts both ore and metal ingots as raw materials. For example,
you could produce steel from both iron ore and iron ingots.

Despite steel being an alloy, game mechanics does not require carbon as
a second component (as of now), but, for convenience, steel is placed in
the alloys category.

Furnace could be made with either 10 stones or 10 pieces of clay.

<big>**Gunpowder**</big>
Gunpowder is produced by mixing mineral coal (carbon, actually), sulphur
and saltpeter, 1 unit of each, in a barrel. This produces 9 units of
gunpowder. There are alternative ways to acquire ingredients, but for
that see the **[Guide to Chemistry](Guide_to_Chemistry "wikilink")**.

## Construction

It is truly a marvel, that from this dusty dirt under our feet, these
heaps of rugged stones and those chaotically growing trees could spring
such smooth, even walls in all their rectangular glory. A natural
landscape is a wild beast that needs to be reined in, and reined in it
will be\!

There are a few key elements in the area of construction that you could
combine and rearrange as you see fit to raise buildings, lay roads and
develop infrastructure as a whole that is both functional and pleasing
to the eye. These elements are walls, floors, doors, windows, roofs and
barricades along with fences. There are also somewhat distinct
categories of fortifications and lighting.

**Mind that the orientation of some constructions depends on the
direction your character is facing\!** For example, some walls are built
vertically if you are facing North or South, or horizontally, if you are
facing East or West. Some wall types also have separate corner elements
for better appearance. All of this is marked in the description of a
specific construction. **N, S, W, E** mean you need to be facing either
North, South, West and East to build a wall the same as the image;
**All** means the construction will look the same regardless of the
direction.

**Some wall tiles change their appearance depending on neighbouring
walls of the same type, so they connect seamlessly to each other.**
These walls are marked as **Adaptive**.

### Construction materials

A few more details about particular materials.

#### Bricks

Bricks and blocks are made with
**[Clay](Full_Crafting_List#clay "wikilink")**, which is obtained from
**[dirt](#Soil "wikilink")**.

  - First, make batches of unfired bricks.

### Walls

<hr>

**Deconstruction**
Any kind of wood walls could be set on fire by hitting them with a
torch. A wall will burn down in a few minutes, destroying the roof tiles
supported by the wall as well (more in the
**[Roofs](#Roofs "wikilink")** section). **Remove the grass and the wood
floor around the wall if you are going to burn it\!** Otherwise the fire
will very likely spread from the burning wall.

Another way is simple brute force - hit a wall with melee weapons, and
it will go down sooner or later. Stone walls, the strongest ones, take
around 100 hits to bring down, or fewer if your strength is high and you
apply a weapon with high damage.

<big><u>**Straw**</u></big>
Made with 4 wood logs. Very primitive, but it still provides shelter, if
a flimsy one.

### Roofs

<hr>

Roofs provide shelter from bad weather, e.g. rains, blizzards and
sandstorms, as well as a nice cool shade.

Roofs are supported by walls, wooden roof supports and stone pillars and
columns. **Mine supports do not hold the buildable roof\!**

The image below shows the roof area supported by either a roof support
(pillars and columns support the same area) or a wall (all walls support
the same area.)

<https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/439888081231937552/647786671718268929/roof_area.png">

There is a variety of roofs to build from different materials (see below
- hover the mouse cursor over a roof builder's icon to see the cost and
the material). Roof icons are adaptive, similarly to some of the walls,
so they change their appearance, depending on the roof in neighbouring
tiles.

**To construct a roof, take a respective roof builder and either click
it in your hand, or press Ctrl-Z or Z in the hotkeys mode.** A roof tile
will be constructed in the tile in front of you, the one you are facing,
if there is a suitable support nearby.

**To deconstruct a roof, click it with the hammer.** Either stand
outside the roof, so you can see it, or hold Alt and click the tile with
the roof. An additional "Turf" tab will appear in the upper right corner
- click the roof there with the hammer in the active hand.

**If roof supports are removed with the roof still present, the roof
will collapse\! Collapsing roof may severely injure and even kill those
in the roofed area, or even standing next to it.**

### Floors

<hr>

No more sloshing or plodding through the mud and snow\! Walk the
civilized way, swiftly and with resonant "top-top" footfalls\! Not only
that - floors on the surface prevent digging upwards from the
underground. Floors can be removed with the hammer.

At the moment, craftable stairs are purely cosmetic and cannot be used
to travel between different Z levels. Nevertheless, they still could be
used to create an impression of height difference.

Stairs on the images are built while facing **S**; directions **N, W,
E** are also available. Hover the mouse cursor over the images to see
the cost and the material.

### Doors

Hover the mouse cursor over the images to see the cost, the material and
the direction (how it looks when built while facing either N, S, W or E.
"All" means a door always looks the same.)

Only the doors marked as "locked" in the crafting menu could be locked
with a key (the iron and jail doors currently) - more details below.

<big><u>**Barricades**</u></big>
**Dirt and snow** - take a pile of respective material in your hand and
click one of the tiles next to the tile you are standing on. This will
start building a barricade at the adjacent tile. Add 3 more piles to
finish it.

**Rock** - crafted with 3 stone.

**Sandbag** - make empty sandbags with
**[Cloth](Full_Crafting_List#cloth "wikilink")** and fill them with sand
piles, then build the barricade like a dirt/snow one.

**All barricades could be dismantled by clicking them with an empty
hand.**

**Barricades provide some protection from ranged attacks when you stand
right next to and behind them.**

### Fortifications

### Lighting

## Machinery

The steel embodiment of Progress.

### Engines

The mechanisms that extract and convert the energy contained in various
fuels.

Engines could be used dually - as a vehicle engine or as an electric
generator. Every type of engine has several key parameters that remain
constant, but, for practical purposes, only one key parameter could be
taken into account:

  -
    **Power per 1 litre (1000 cm<sup>3</sup>)** - the power produced by
    a given type of engine per every 1000 cc of its size. This is the
    meaning behind the number in an engine's description. **For the game
    mechanic purposes, the value of the engine power is doubled when an
    engine is installed on a modular vehicle.**

The power affects how many pieces of machinery could be powered by an
engine if used as a generator, or, if used as a vehicle engine, the
maximum weight it could carry.

**Engine as a generator**
To supply various devices with electricity, the engine has to be
connected to them with wires (cables). See the
**[Wiring](#Wiring "wikilink")** section for more details.

#### Construction

To construct any engine, save for the steam engine (which also does not
need a fuel tank), you will need the engine maker (made with 5 iron
ingots).

  - Have the engine maker in your active hand and a stack of steel
    sheets in the other hand.
  - Click the engine maker, or press Ctrl-Z or Z in the hotkeys mode.
  - Choose the engine type. Note that different engines need various
    amounts of steel per 1000 cc.
  - Enter the size of the engine to build.
  - Build a fuel tank with steel sheets, take it in hand and connect it
    to the engine by clicking. To remove a fuel tank, right-click the
    engine and choose the "Remove fuel tank" command.

Available at 95 Industrial research. Made with 15 steel sheets (engine), plus 15 iron ingots (furnace). This engine requires an external combustion source, and that is the function of the iron furnace.<br />
Build both the furnace and the engine, and place them next to each other, in neighbouring tiles. Add fuel to the furnace and click the furnace to light the fire. Now click the steam engine to start it. As long as the furnace has fire burning and remains next to the engine, the engine will keep working.</p></td>

### Wiring

The wonderful world of wires\!

Once you have a roaring power generator, it is time for electricity to
spring forth and animate the silent apparatus, to spread across the
world and become its galvanic soul. Here is the process of laying
electrical cables.

    1\. Make some cables with copper, 1 ingot per every 10 meters of
    cable (1 m - 1 tile). Stand in one place to make the cable in a
    single coil, which could be up to 50 m in length.

<!-- end list -->

  -
    2\. Lay the cable on the ground by clicking it in your active hand,
    pressing Ctrl-Z or Z in the hotkeys mode.
    :\* **The cable is placed horizontally when you are facing West or
    East, and vertically, if facing North or South. Cables that cross on
    a single tile are automatically connected upon placement.**
    :\* If you are placing cables over some kind of floor, the cables
    are automatically placed under the floor tiles and concealed from
    view. You can make them visible by right-clicking the floor tile and
    selecting the "Under/over covers" command for the cable.
    :\* You can cut and remove cables with the knife.

<!-- end list -->

  -
    3\. Connect the machinery (you may need to secure it with the wrench
    first, in which case there will be a message). **Stand close to it
    and click it with the cable - you will see a message. Do not place
    cables under the machinery beforehand, it will remain unconnected.**
    Remember to place another wire at the tile you are standing on.

<!-- end list -->

  -
    4\. Fire up the generator\! Should a new piece of machinery be
    connected to the existing network, the generator must be restarted
    to power the new element.

### Modular ships

<hr>

Rafts and outriggers do not befit a true naval power, so when your
nation has its eye on distant shores, it may be just the time to open
shipyards and commission a man-of-war or two.

<big>**Shipyard considerations**</big>
While selecting a place for shipbuilding, keep in mind the following:

  - The maximum size of a ship is 5x5 tiles. Larger ones will not
    function properly due to technical reasons.
  - A ship has to be of rectangular shape.
  - A ship is facing North by default.
  - A ship must be built on water tiles, otherwise it won't move.
  - The flooded trenches are navigable and could be traversed on a ship.
    You can dig a single wide trench next to a body of water and build a
    ship inside the trench. You could also dig a trench around the ship
    to allow more space for maneuvering.

**You can fix the walls and frames and the mast in place with the wrench
to avoid pushing them on accident, but it is not necessary.**

1.  Build a wood ship frame with wood logs. The frame on the picture is
    5x3 tiles.
2.  Click ship frame tiles with wood logs to place walls and windows.
    Enter the desired thickness for every wall in millimeters.
      - **Wall (W)** - just a wooden impassable wall. Examples of walls
        are in the middle and at the bow of the ship on the picture.
      - **Crenelated wall (CW)** - a wall with a doorway that could be
        used to enter or leave the ship. Examples of crenelated walls
        are on the left and right side of the ship on the picture, two
        on each side, closer to the bow and the stern.
      - **Window (Wi)** - just a cosmetic option. On the picture, there
        is a single window at the bow and three at the stern.
3.  Build a ship rudder control and a mast (one is enough for now) with
    wood logs. Their location is not important. **Make a small sail with
    15 lengths of cloth and place it on the mast.**
      - The mast is actually larger than 1 tile, so its positioning is a
        bit quirky. See the picture below - this is how the mast is
        built when facing North:

4.  **Build a ship rudder axis at the top left corner of the ship.**
    There are two axes, but for now you can always select a regular axis
    with 2500 carried weight. Click the axis to finish building the
    ship.

<ul>
<li>A motor ship with an engine is sensitive to the weight it carries, so the engine must produce enough power. An engine the size of 12000-15000 cc should be adequate for almost any ship.</li>

### Modular tanks

<hr>

Indispensable political instruments in later ages, perfectly suited for
settling disputes and establishing accord on all fronts.

Tank driving is covered in the **[Guide to
Tanks](Guide_to_Tanks "wikilink")**.

<big>**Limitations**</big>
\* The maximum size of a tank is 5x5 tiles. Larger ones will not
function properly due to technical reasons.

  - A tank has to be of rectangular shape.
  - A tank is facing North by default.

**Everything inside the tank, except for the tank tracks and the vehicle
axis, could be placed anywhere.**

**You can fix the walls and frames and the tank cannon in place with the
wrench to avoid pushing them on accident, but it is not necessary.**

1.  Build a steel vehicle frame with steel sheets. The frame on the
    picture is 3x4 tiles.
2.  Click vehicle frame tiles with steel sheets to place walls and
    doors. Enter the desired armour thickness in millimeters.
      - **Armoured Front (AF)** - stronger than the regular wall.
      - **Wall (W)** - a steel impassable wall.
      - **Door (D)** - used to enter or exit the vehicle. Could be
        locked with a key.
3.  Place tank tracks inside the walls and on the frame itself. Face
    North to build tracks like those in the front, or South to build
    them like those in the back.
4.  Construct an **[engine](#Engines "wikilink")** with a fuel tank.
      - It is important to make an engine of an appropriate size that
        produces enough power to carry a tank and its load. A weak
        engine will not be able to move the weight of a tank. You can
        check engine's maximum power by examining the engine. For
        instance, the weight of the tank built here is approximately 650
        without any crew or shells. You can check the current weight by
        examining the steel frame inside the tank ("floor") once its
        construction has been finished.
      - As a rule of thumb, an engine of 8000-10000 cc should be more
        than enough for a medium-sized tank.
5.  Place the tank cannon (enter the desired caliber) and the seats: D -
    driver, C - commander, L - loader, G - gunner.
6.  **Build a heavy vehicle axis at the top left corner.** Click the
    axis to select a colour palette and a name for the tank.
7.  Admire the interior of the death machine you have created (place a
    shell rack, the one beside the fuel tank, to keep things
    organized)...
8.  ... and the exterior.

<big>**Repairs**</big>
\* Broken tank tracks could be repaired with the welding tool (made with
steel.)
