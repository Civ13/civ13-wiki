###### Give your local femboy a headpat - HumbleServant#5100

**Introduction**

It is the midst of war when the Russians captured you from the battlefield as you surrender or forcibly out of your home as debts and taxes piles up.
You were taken to an unknown location in the middle of Siberia and you can recall the journey clear as day as you almost froze to death in the cargo truck
guarded by heavily armed personnel from the Red Army and there's barely any town to be seen in the distance nor signs of life.
Soon, You can see a dim light in the distance despite your vision is all blurry from thick layer of fog, closer and closer, there's a signage that catches your eyes. 
"Gulag"

## Welcome to Gulag

Gulag is an **MRP/HRP** map where you spend the rest of your lives either as one of the guards or as prisoners and the goal here is not to kill randomly
but to work as a team and to rack up as much **rubbles** as you can by engaging in every activities that can be found in the Gulag.

**Always Remember:**
*While death through gang fight or turf war is inevitable and unavoidable, whoever kills a prisoner is liable to get killed on sight for murder or punished accordingly by the guards and if death occured in the ranks of guards or the lieutenant/supervisor of Gulag is killed, they are given an option to call a Deathsquad/KGB to kill prisoners on sight to end the round in Draw.*

# Guards Guidelines and Regulations:

So! You're the new replacement! Welcome to the Gulag where forced labor is much cheaper than contractors and humane working environment is a myth fabricated by capitalist pigs.

As a guard, you're equipped with necessary tools to ~~beat the shit out of prisoners~~ bring order and ~~killing prisoner without legal consequence~~ discipline among the rowdy prisoners.

## In your belt, you'll find:
 - **Whistle** to alarm other guards and prisoners. 
 - **Handcuffs** for ~~kinky stuffs~~ detaining prisoners.
 - **Binocular** which is useful for people who's assigned to watchtowers.
 - **Baton** that immediately put prisoners to the ground once they took a hit or two. 
 
Note: *You gotta love these batons since they will be your bestfriend until your lieutenant decided to open the armory and arm every single one of you with AK and Shotguns.*

### Now that you are armed and ready, here are the things you can do as guard to ensure safety and enforce forced labor amongst the prisoners:

**Killing a prisoner for their rubbles is oocly punishable.**
 - This is considered as RDM and greatly frowned upon by the community and thus, you should avoid this. Similarly, Prisoners can **bribe** you to let them go, be freed from the containment cell and lastly, being supplied with foods, weapons (Don't supply them with ballistics weaponry.) or medical supplies. (Surgery kit is the highest priced item totalling up to 300 or less rubbles.)

**Maintain an absolute peace and order among the prisoners**
 - Punish them accordingly to the crime committed but shouldn't be killed as it would prove disadvantageous to your goal. You may however remove their limbs as punishment unless they paid generously to keep their legs.

**If it's time for work then EVERYONE should work.**
 - There should be no prisoners to be found outside the mining, there can be only one guard patrolling sniffing out prisoners (Don't come inside the underground fightclub.)

**Patrol with your buddy**
 - You must always have a partner to patrol with you around the gulag. Gulag is a nasty and opportunistic place where anything is possible to happen, never go alone or prisoners might just beat you up for your keys and equipment.
 
 **A dead prisoner is not so cash money for motherland.**
 - Prevent fights, do an inspection and relieve them of contrabands, these are one of the things you can do to prevent death in Gulag. Keep them alive but don't waste your precious medical equipment to save them, medical equipment are much costly than replacing a dead prisoner.

## Mining Protocols
 
### Before Mining 
- Make sure to list every equipment that can be found inside the mining closets as well as what can be found in the mining shaft.
- Take note of who goes in and out of the mining by taking their ID before they go in then hand it over as soon as they hand over their mining bags.
- Make sure no one tries to escape by assigning all guards to watch over the prisoners while mining except for one who'll snuff out any violators.
- Ores can be melted by the fire, make sure no one tries to make a shank out of melted ores and shoot them on sight or arrest them if they do.
- Always guard the prisoner while mining and never let them bring home any of materials, ore, or any equipment.

### After Mining
- One by one, prisoners should put their equipment back to the lockers except for their mining bag while being carefully checked by the guards before they come out in properly lined
- They should hand over the mining bag, have the resources sold to the vendor in the minecart room, then give them 60% of the calculated rubbles as well as their ID back.
- If there is a missing equipment in the lockers then inform your higher ups to immediately do an immediate inspection of their cells, their clothes and everywhere in the prison.
- Role Call is a must that every prisoner is required to attend, otherwise they are valid to face severe consequences. (You may beat them up, steal half of their rubbles but never all of their rubbles.)
- Miners should be **payed** to keep them happy, these can be used to buy stuff in your departments (Food and Medical Supplies is likely to be bought by prisoners or Shanks/Knifes to be used.)

## Cafeteria Protocols

### Before Cafeteria
- There should be a representative of each faction to man the cafeteria.
- IF the said representative of faction starts asking for "Payment", you are expected for a cut. Otherwise, disallow it since it always turn bloodbath afterward.
- Prisoners are allowed to skip cafeteria but never to be served until next cafeteria time.

### While Cafeteria
- You can do nothing but observe, let the prisoners have their daily dose of beating eachother until someone dies then, only then you are allowed to intervene.

### After Cafeteria
- Force every prisoners to properly clean up, fix the stool and place the plate back to the counter.
- OPTIONAL: IF SOMEONE SHITS ON THE FLOOR, KILL THEM WITHOUT PREJUDICE OR BETTER YET LET EVERYBODY BEAT HIM TO DEATH.
- OPTIONAL: IF THEIR NAME IS SIROBAR ON DISCORD, KILL THEM. THEY ARE BAD GULAG PLAYER - HumbleServant

# Prisoner's Guide to Gulag
*Your goal is not to escape, kill guards or kill fellow prisoners even if they are from different gang/team but instead Focus on getting more money. You're still free to kill fellow prisoner without ooc admin intervention but where's the fun in that?*

**Your goal is to gather as much rubble as possible.**

And there's plenty of ways to earn this.

1. Mining 
 - Mining is easy but the price of your hard work is easily manipulated by the guards on duty but regardless You should be payed and if they didn't, Ask the admin what should be your next step on dealing with this particular guard.

2. Underground Fight Club 
 - What goes in the fight club stays in the fight club. Make sure to not kill any your opponent and stay humble and honorable. Surrendered opponent shouldn't be killed otherwise, this gives the guard of the fight club a reason to shoot you on sight and observers shouldn't intervene.

3.Services 
 - Theres alot of services you can offer to the prisoners, one of these are **medical services**, **'beat-a-prisoner'** services and lastly, **Cafeteria services**.
 
 *Note: Mind you that these services can be protected by the prison guards if they are paid well.*

This is for the prisoners only.
Remember, the best way to enjoy the round is acting accordingly and appropriately to the setting.

Oh and **Escape is not advised nor is it wise thing to do.**
