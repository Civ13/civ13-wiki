# The City of Pepelsibirsk
Welcome to Pepelsibirsk, a humble city in the northern Urals. The weather is cold and drab - certainly no tropical resort!  
The year is 1976. The Soviet central government has collapsed following a limited nuclear exchange with the United States. The city must govern itself, trading with neighbouring settlements and remaining military installations to guarantee its continued survival and security.

This map has special mechanics and is designed for a specific type of realistic roleplay, so I would highly recommend reading (or better yet - keeping on-hand) the following guide. It is useful for prospective rulers, government ministers, tyrants, rebels, criminals, businessmen, and even common citizens.

# Politics
*These are just RP suggestions - feel free to come up with your own system of government. Note, however, that the following wiki is written with the historical system in mind.*

### Historical
Historically, the Soviet government operated using a theoretically "bottom-up" system, in which local Soviets (councils) elected by industrial, agricultural, and military personnel sent delegates to regional Soviets, eventually going all the way up to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, or, earlier, the Congress of Soviets. Candidates in these elections were required approval by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and elections were not competitive - you could merely vote for or against a candidate, the latter only being successful in isolated cases. Factionalism was banned (theoretically an emergency measure enacted in 1921, but this ban on factions remained until 1989) and Soviets were always expected to vote unanimously, resulting in minimal diversity of opinion and the Soviets being reduced to a de-facto rubber stamp for the bureaucratized CPSU.

This system can be implemented on a smaller scale in Pepelsibirsk, using the City Soviet as a stand-in for the Supreme Soviet, with the city's ruler being Chairman of the Communist Party of Pepelsibirsk (or whatever you choose to call it).

### Soviet Democracy
This is similar to the historical system, but without the ban on factionalism and competitive elections within the Soviets. This is similar to the system initially implemented at the start of the October Revolution, and can be considered a form of semi-direct democracy.

### Anarchism
Another socialist system, anarchism in this guide is represented as a more decentralized form of Soviet Democracy. The state is minimal, with all decisions made democratically by the Soviets. Civil liberties are absolute, and legal punishments are minimized as much as possible. The power of the Supreme Soviet is reduced to only military and diplomatic affairs. Economically, money is either abolished or reduced in importance, and all businesses are operated as community-run cooperatives - the factory worker runs the factory, the farmer runs the farm, and the soldier runs the brigade. Even in the army, the soldiers are expected to elect their commanding officers, subject to recall at any time.

### Parliamentary Republic
In a parliamentary republic, an elected parliament runs the state, typically with a Chancellor or Prime Minister chosen to be the head of government (and de-facto head of state). It is a non-socialist system of government, and does not make use of workplace democracy, typically preferring simple multi-party elections. An example to follow would be the Federal Republic of Germany, led by a Chancellor.

### Directorial Republic
In a directorial republic, multiple people serve as Head of State and sometimes Head of Government, typically operating alongside an elected parliament, though not always. This system can be combined with either socialist or non-socialist systems; historically, the Soviet Union used a similar system of "Collective Leadership" in which multiple people had near-equal power in the CPSU, particularly during the Brezhnev era. Switzerland uses this system as well, as did the Roman Republic and both the French Directory and Consulate.

### Presidential Republic
In a Presidential Republic, the government is dominated by the executive officer, typically titled President, who serves as both Head of Government and Head of State. Radical republicans in the 18th and 19th centuries tended to institute these. Examples include most states in the Americas (incl. the United States), Turkey, and South Korea. 

# Ministries
You will want at the very least a Ministry of Internal Affairs, a Ministry of Economic Planning, and a Ministry of Defense.

### Ministry of Internal Affairs
This ministry handles internal law & order, and contains both the intelligence services (KGB) and law enforcement (Militsiya). You will need them to make sure the laws are followed and efficiency is maintained.

### Ministry of Economic Planning
This ministry handles both distribution of resources and imports/exports. Insufficient staffing here will lead to supply shortages and mismanagement. It also handles pricing, assigning workers, and wages.

In a market system, substitute this with the Ministry of Economics, a drastically reduced ministry with its purview limited to imports and exports.

### Ministry of Defense
This ministry handles the city's defense and internal security against armed revolutionaries, as well as the protection of military arsenals. It can additionally serve as a reserve force for the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

### Buildings requiring management
The following buildings/compounds/factories may need managers assigned at the start of the game:
- In the far east of the map, there is a combined prison/police station. This may be effectively used to suppress and contain *hardened criminals*.
- Just south of the city Soviet is located a hospital, well-equipped to deal with the injuries naturally caused whilst preserving the legacy of October.
- In the center of the map is a warehouse, equipped with the latest advances in *☭Soviet Superscience☭*, allowing you to easily view its complete contents. Use this to assist in resource allocation and planning.
- In the northeast of the map is a large mine and steel mill, which can be used to extract minerals and clay for both domestic use and export.
- In the southwest of the map is a car factory, well equipped for the mass production of vehicles.
- In the northwest is a huge collective farm. It requires a large labor force to plow, but its theoretical capacity is enormous compared to the city's population.

# Trade & Diplomacy
There are other settlements and powers which can be traded with. You must maintain your relations with these settlements to maintain your economy.

### Pepelsibirsk-1
Unrelated to Pepelsibirsk itself, this is a military settlement. You may purchase weapons from it. If relations with it are low, it will send raiders to attack Pepelsibirsk.

### Narodnyygorod
A small town located near Pepelsibirsk, containing a port. It is somewhat wealthy, but maintains a defensive military posture. If relations with it are low, it will embargo you. This is your only source of rubles.

### The Chinese
The wastes of the eastern RSFSR have proven to be very lucrative for the People's Republic of China. They will send traders periodically. If relations with them are low, they will constantly bomb the city and stop sending traders. If relations are high, they will provide small amounts of "humanitarian aid" with every trading party.

### The Soviet Union
What little remains of the Soviet central government. They are willing to tolerate your de-facto independence as long as you provide a steady source of revenue. They will periodically send traders. If relations with them are low, they will constantly bomb the city and stop sending traders. If relations are high, they will protect you against Pepelsibirsk-1's raids and Chinese airstrikes.

### The United States of the Pacific
Following the collapse of the United States, the governments of California, Nevada, Oregon, Arizona, Utah, Idaho, and Washington State formed a federation for mutual protection and economic benefit. They are willing to sell you very advanced technology at high prices, and will periodically send traders. Trading with these Americans will reduce relations with the Chinese and Soviet Union. If relations are low, they will permanently stop sending traders.

### Managing Relations
Diplomatic relations are naturally raised via trading, and lowered by scams and hostility.

Purchasing items from a trader or buying/selling imports/exports will increase relations by 0.1 per ruble spent or earned.

You can kill visiting traders to make them drop valuable items and money. This will immediately reduce relations by 20.

You can scam Pepelsibirsk-1 and Narodnyygorod out of their money by choosing not to pay for imported goods. This will reduce relations by 15 per crate.

Relations go from 0 to 100, anything below 25 counting as hostile and anything above 75 counting as friendly.
