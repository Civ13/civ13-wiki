# Starter Guide

## Spawning in

  - When you spawn, you will be told the languages you know. Your
    appearance and language will be determined by your spawn location.
  - Your **hunger** and **thirst** levels will both be at 50%.
  - You start out with nothing but age-appropriate clothes on your person. Your first priority will be gathering flint to make a
    flint axe. 
      - Find a large rock and click it on Grab intent - you should
        be able to gather some flint. 
      - Click the rock repeatedly with the flint to sharpen it (you will get a message when it is sharpened).
      - Now go to a tree and click it on Harm intent. This will pull a
        branch from the tree and place it on the ground. 
      - Click the branch with Grab intent to clear the leaves, then click again with Harm intent to pull out the twigs.
      - Use the sharpened flint on the stick to sharpen it, then click the sharpened stick with the flint again to craft
        yourself a trusty flint axe, a tool and a weapon.
  - If it's **winter season** or **Ice Age** map, you also spawn with a
    **fur coat**. Losing this will mean cold and miserable **death** in
    the icy outdoors.

## Crafting Basics

You will need some basic things to survive. At the very start you will most likely be using **wood** to make them.

  - Hit a tree with your flint hatchet and it will be cut down after a
    delay.
  - Get the wood and use it in the active hand to open a crafting menu.

The same mechanic for opening crafting menu applies to all materials.
Activate in hand to open the crafting menu.

## Staying alive

To survive, you will need to keep yourself nourished and warm.

<img src="assets/images/hud_stomach.png"><br>
Click your **Thirst** and **Hunger** **icon** on the right side (stomach icon) to
know how you're doing.

**Letting either hunger or thirst reach 0% will cause your body to start shutting down, leading to inevitable death!**

Hunger and thirst affect your **movement speed**, **healing
rates** and **[mood](#mood "wikilink")**.

Being slow makes you easy prey for predators, criminals, and
cannibals. Malnourishment also makes it easier to catch **[diseases](Guide_to_Medical#diseases "wikilink")**.

### Hunger

The easiest way to get food early on is by killing animals and eating
the meat after cooking it. Also, you can eat bird eggs, even uncooked!

  - Find an animal, preferably one that
    doesn't have fangs, claws, tusks, or poison. and kill it with any means (even bare fists work). **Stay away from bears,
    alligators, wolves, snakes, and mammoths.**
  - Use your knife (flint axe works too) on the dead animal with **Harm intent** to butcher it.
  - **Raw meat** causes **food poisoning**! You'll want to **cook** it,
    **stew** it or **dry** it first, but if you're
    starving, food poisoning is the least of your worries.
  - To cook meat, place it on a **campfire** and click the campfire.
    - Campfire is made with **wood logs** ("kitchen" section).
      - You can also roast meat in an **oven**.
  - To **dry** meat, cut the raw steak into **raw cutlets** with a knife, then place
    them on a **dehydrator** and wait.
      - Dehydrators are made of **wood**, but you need some research
        levels.
  - To **stew** meat, place the raw steak into the **cooking pot** after
    filling it with **water**, and wait.
      - Cooking pots are made with **iron ingots**, but again, it
        requires research levels to make.
  - **Cold can kill**. Being caught in a **blizzard** or **winter**
    without proper protection is a very easy way to **die**.

There are many ways to fill your stomach. Even an *unga
dunga* can do it!

  - **[Guide to Farming](Guide_to_Farming "wikilink")**
  - **[Guide to Cooking](Guide_to_Cooking "wikilink")**

### Thirst

The easiest way to quench your thirst early on is by drinking water or
milk, though other liquids like **tea** can also be used.

#### Water

You can get water from **puddles**, any **water tiles (except saltwater - do not drink nor boil it!)**, or **wells**.

  - To drink, you need to make a **mug** from **wood** or **drinking
    glass** from **glass**.
  - **Wells** have disease-free freshwater. You can build them over a
    **puddle** by using with **stone**... if your faction has the
    research levels required.
  - "Raw" water needs to be **boiled** to be 100% safe. Otherwise, you
    have a **chance** of catching **cholera**. Though if you're dying,
    raw water will be a risk you'll have to take.
  - To boil water, make a pot from **tin** or **copper** ingots.
      - **Intermission: MINING BASICS**: You'll need **wood** and **bone**
        for this. Go gather them (bones are obtained by butchering animals),
          - Make a **tool handle** from **wood** ("tools" section).
          - Hold it in the **off-hand**.
          - Activate some **bone** in your **active hand**.
          - Make a **bone pickaxe**.
          - Find a **rock** and use the **pickaxe** on it. **WARNING: BUILD
            MINING SUPPORTS WITH WOOD EVERY 2 TILES OR YOU WILL HAVE A
            CAVE-IN**
          - Grab the **copper or tin ores** and **smelt them** into
            **ingots** in a **campfire**.
          - Use the **ingots** in-hand to craft a **pot**.
  - Fill the **pot** with **water**, place it on **campfire** or
    **oven**, turn it on, and wait for it to finish boiling.
  - Water is then safe to drink. Pour it in your **mug** or **glass**
    and drink.

#### Milk

  - Find a **cow**, **sheep ewe**, or **goat ewe**.
  - Make a **bucket** from **wood**.
  - Use the **bucket** on **help intent** on the animal of choice to
    gather milk.
  - Pour the milk into the **mug** or **glass** and drink.
  - You don't have to boil milk.

Milk is regenerated in the animals over time, so keep them alive, and
you'll never go thirsty.

#### Palm wine

**[Palm wine](Guide_to_Cooking#palm-wine "wikilink")** could save your life in the desert areas. Follow the steps in the **[Guide to Cooking](Guide_to_Cooking "wikilink")** to make it (glass is made by firing dug sand piles in the campfire).

### Mood

<img src="assets/images/hud_mood.png"><br>
Click this icon to see your current mood and **[hygiene](Guide_to_Hygiene "wikilink")** levels. When you need to go to the toilet, it will also tell you how exactly you need to... relieve yourself.

Are you constantly feeling depressed? Getting weird audio randomly out
of nowhere? Well, then you've got a shit mood! Here are the ways
to increase your mood:

1.  Drugs, such as cocaine and opium. Smoking tobacco as well.
2.  Good **[complex foods](Guide_to_Cooking "wikilink")** like boiled rice, roasted meat steak, noodles,
    sandwiches, etc.
3.  Alcohol, like vodka and sake.

Things that can decrease mood:

1.  Other people's stench (when they have a cloud of filth around them,
    they decrease your mood and you get a message that they smell).
2.  Your own stench.
3.  Your own low **hygiene**.
4.  Killing others (drastically decreases mood, especially cutting someone's head off).
5.  Eyeing delimbed body parts and gore.

**Seeing too much of extreme gore will result in developing PTSD, which is incurable!** After a while, you will start hallucinating and having catatonic breakdowns. Antidepressants and drugs will temporarily block these effects.

Now you know how to manage your mood with these not so effective up
keeps! But did you know mood affects more than you thought? Mood can
affect your max **[skill stats](Guide_to_Character#skills "wikilink")**. If you're feeling great, you can
have 2.875 as a stat cap. When your mood is shit, it can only be 2.0 (it
will appear as 20x, but it's actually 2.0x) So your mood can actually
affect your ability to do things and speed of doing things greatly, and
thus does matter, especially in combat situations.

### Temperature

<img src="assets/images/hud_temperature.png"><br>
**Keep an eye out on your temperature icon!** 

**If it is flashing blue with a white snowflake, you are freezing up!**

**If it is red and there is sun instead, you are melting from heat!**

Winter seasons can bring an icy chill that can seriously hurt and slow you down, or even kill you. Blizzards are especially deadly, and just wearing a fur coat will not cut it, so make sure you have a shelter ready before it is too late.

Southern climates could be merciless in their own way, so be careful that you do not overheat to the point of a heat stroke. Resting in a roofed shelter from time to time and wearing appropriate clothing (for instance, "traditional" desert clothes) can save you from fainting and shrivelling in a sweltering heat.

#### Fur Clothing

Fur clothing can keep you warm in the winter, but it will not save you if you are caught in a blizzard.

You can make fur clothing by skinning large furry animals like **bears**
and **wolves**. <sub>Yes, you can finally skin furries with no
repercussions.</sub>

  - Kill a **bear** or **wolf**.
  - Skin the animal by using the **knife** on **Grab intent**.
  - Collect the pelts and craft **fur coat, boots, headcover and gloves** (you will need to hunt several animals for the whole set).

#### Shelter

Shelter can save you from even the toughest of conditions.

Any roofed area is considered a shelter.

  - **Caves**: There's a reason that stone-age men were called cavemen.
    Look for entrances in rocks. If it has a roof, it will be darker
    inside. That means it will keep snow, cold, blazing sun and rain out. The
    easiest way of surviving inclement weather. <sub>Make sure that no
    bears live in the cave, though...</sub>
  - **Tunnels / "Mines"**: You can dig into the underground for
    shelter\! All you need is to use a **shovel** in your active hand.
    To craft one, you'll need to make a **tool handle** with **wood logs**, and have **bones** available. With the **tool handle** in
    the off-hand, activate **bone** in the active hand.
  - **Building a Roof**: Target your inner Bob the Builder and build
    your own roof. You'll need **wood logs**.
      - Build **walls** or **roof supports** to prop the ceiling up.
      - Build a **roof builder**, hold it, and activate it in hand while
        facing the tile above which you want to build.
      - You can also build walls with **dirt** or **snow** by using the
        **shovel** directly on the ground. Just use the **dirt** or
        **snow** piles in your **active hand**, then add additional
        material directly to the wall.

#### Fire

Crackling fires will keep you warm even without a coat.

* A **campfire** warms you when you are right next to it, or within 1 tile.
* A **brazier** (made with **stone**) provides more heat and warms you within 3 tiles.
* Both campfire and brazier are refueled by adding **wood**, **coal** and **charcoal**. Brazier could also be refueled with **paper- and cloth-based items**.

### Dangerous animals

The world is teeming with wildlife. Most of them are pretty tame and
easy prey, but steer clear of the big game unless you're a skilled
hunter, otherwise you'll become minced meat yourself\!

You want to avoid these, unless you're robust or need some pelts:

  - Bears (can provide fur)
  - Wolves (can provide fur)
  - Mammoths
  - Panthers & Jaguars
  - Snakes
  - Piranhas (inhabit jungle river waters. Throw some meat in the water if it looks suspicious.)
  - Mosquitoes
  - Alligators

### Night time

You'll need a light source to see in the night and in dark indoor areas.

The basic source of light is the **torch**.

  - Gather some **wood**.
  - Craft a **torch** and click it in hand to light it. Click it again to put it out for the time being.
  - An alternative to the torch is a tiki torch that is stationary and burns for longer and makes for a brighter source of light.

Torches will last for **5 minutes** and then burn out.

  - You can also make lanterns with **iron**. Lanterns require fuel - any form of liquid fuel will do.

For a more **permanent** light source, you can build **braziers** from
**stone**. You can fuel it with any organic matter like wood or
clothing, simply use items on the brazier on **help intent**.

## Saving your character
If you simply log off, your character will be left unconscious and helpless, lying face-down on the floor, liable to get killed or robbed or just starve to death.

To avoid that, go to sleep properly:
- Stand over a bed or buckle yourself to a leather bedroll (no need to buckle to beds). **Do not have anything in your hands - you will lose it permanently!**
- Type "sleep" in the chat (without "say") or click "Sleep" on the IC tab.
- Wait 2 minutes to be teleported to a safe zone.
- Sleep tight. Now you can log off. If you go to sleep with full stomach (100% of food and water), your character will last about 3 RL days. All things you have on yourself will be safe, **except that you drop whatever you have in your hands, leaving it in the sleep zone!**
- To wake up, type "wake-up" (again, without "say") or click "Wake Up" on the IC tab. You will be teleported to the spot where you went to sleep.

## Additional info
### Status tab
The Status tab has some general info about the ongoing round, both OOC and IC, namely:
- number of players
- round duration
- current map
- current mode (usually states **[research](Civilizations_and_Nomads#research "wikilink")** mode)
- current epoch
- current wind (important if you are sailing)
