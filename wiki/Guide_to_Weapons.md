## How to use artillery

This is the artillery menu. From the top to the bottom:

1.  The shell you have loaded
2.  How far you are aiming to hit
3.  The deviation to the right/left of the shell (from your character's point of view)

![image](assets/images/LWR7LVY.png)

To have a higher chance of success at firing artillery shells on your
enemies' territory, it's best if you have a telescope in hand. Or even
better yet, a "spotter" to have their telescope always on the target,
telling you where to aim while you control the artillery.

Each tile further means you'll have to add the value of "1" to the distance. If you want to hit 45 tiles away, you must aim for "45" distance.*

![image](assets/images/BjuQU61.png)

The sway is the "deviation" or just sway, that the shell will be
affected by. If you fire from coordinates that aren't exactly
aligned with your enemy, you can use these to move your shell
left-to-right instead of moving the artillery.

![image](assets/images/uSxJ8hu.png)

You will need to load a shell before firing, you can clearly see if
there's one by checking the panel.

![image](assets/images/MKPjuJy.png)

There are many kinds of shells, like chlorine shells, zyklon B
shells, white phosphorus shells, makeshift nuclear shells and many
more, but let's see these more simple examples.

![image](assets/images/okbGhZ8.png)
This is a <b>H</b>igh-<b>E</b>xplosive shell, it will create a big explosion where
it lands, spreading fire along. Great if your enemy has houses made out
of wood or if there's grass around.

![image](assets/images/N5Xkpza.png)
This is an <b>A</b>rmor-<b>P</b>iercing shell, it will pierce through the armour of
tanks.


**All the other shells are:**
