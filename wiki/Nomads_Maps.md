# Nomads Maps

## Temperate

<img src="assets/images/map_temperate.png">

This is the classic map, using the same map as the Civilizations map.

  - The map climate is temperate, with plenty of forests, rivers,
    overland mines, and farming space.
  - The northern part of the map contains most of the plains, while the
    southern part has most of the swamps and some beaches.
  - You may encounter mice, rabbits, bears, turkeys, cows, goats,
    snakes, deer, fish, frogs, leeches, horses, and alligators.
  - The round always starts in Spring.

## Desert

  - In this map, the whole area is a desert with some sparse water
    sources and farming plots.
  - Water management is important here, as is control of the rare
    farmable areas around rivers and swamps.
  - You may encounter mice, bears, goats, snakes, frogs, leeches,
    horses, camels, and alligators.
  - The round always starts in the Wet Season.

## Jungle

A dense tropical rainforest. You can only farm on the floodplains and during the dry
season. Wildlife is deadly here\! Stay away from panthers, mosquitoes
(as they carry malaria) and ants (will eat your food). Crossing rivers
without a bridge is considered unsafe - piranhas are abundant.

## Divide (Jungle-Desert)

Jungle biome on West side, Desert biome on East side, separated by
mineable mountains and a small patch of clear land filled with
alligators.

## Ice Age

Snow plains with frozen rivers and lakes. Rock is more abundant than wood. You may encounter wolves, deer, bears, penguins, goats, mammoths, and dogs. Summer lasts only 1/4 of the year, the rest is winter.

## Continental

## Pangea

<img src="assets/images/map_pangea.png">

A combined map with no oceans dividing the biomes, excluding mountain ranges.

The biomes are, from North to South:

Tundra, Taiga, Temperate, Semi-Arid, Desert, Savannah, and Jungle

## New World

## Mediterranean

## Island

## Isle 

A small island for 10-15 players, divided by a lava region, jungle/part swamp, and  tundra region.

## Europe

<img src="assets/images/map_europe.png">

A map based off of the European continent, it has a northern region covered in snow based off of Scandinavia and northern Russia..

There is even a temperate biome based off of central europe (France/Germany/northern Balkans), and a semi arid region based off the Mediterranean regions (Iberian peninsula, Italy, and Greece).

Large rivers cover the continent and 7x7 water ways for bridges(tanks and cars) exist on the large rivers.
