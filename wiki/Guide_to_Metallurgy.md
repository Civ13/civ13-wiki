# Guide to Metallurgy

Sticks, stones and bones can only carry you so far, but Mother Nature is infinitely generous with her gifts, among which she includes a marvelous class of materials - metals. Grateful and astounded, we accept it and pledge that it will not be wasted on trifles.  It shall serve us greatly in mastering ways of cutting, slashing, gutting, chopping and slicing. We shall use it to harness flames and tame explosions, to travel swiftly across vast distances and to bring the Torch of Civilization to the realms of dark ignorance! Bless you, Mother!

Metallurgy concerns manipulating raw ores and turning them into metals, from which a myriad of tools, weapons and devices could be produced.

## Basics

### Obtaining metals

Different metals are produced from **[ores](Guide_to_Crafting#ores)** in different furnaces. See sections on furnaces and on respective metals for more details.

### General steps of metalworking

The primary component of metalworking is **[molds](#molds)**. At the very least, you will need a **blacksmith pot** or a **blacksmith jar** to melt ores in them.

* Put ore or metal (ingots) in a blacksmith pot or a blacksmith jar.
* Place a pot or a jar inside a **kiln**.
* Light fire in the kiln and wait until the ore melts.
* Pour molten metal into a mold of your choosing.
* Take the mold and click a suitable(1) anvil with it.
* Select a metal item to make(2).

(1): Some metals could only be worked on a more advanced anvil. For example, iron items are produced on the iron and steel anvils, not on the stone one. See the **[Anvils](#anvils)** section.

(2): The list of available items depends on the epoch.

## Molds

Molds are made with **[Clay](Full_Crafting_List#clay)** and used to cast tools and melee weapons from different metals. Each mold has a certain volume it can hold.  1 unit of volume = 1 unit of ore = 1 unit of molten metal = 1 metal ingot. Making different items requires a different amount of metal.

**Clay molds are made raw and need to be fired in [a campfire or an oven](Guide_to_Crafting#campfire-and-ovens) before using!**

## Furnaces

Furnaces are operated similarly to the **[campfire and ovens](Guide_to_Crafting#campfire-and-ovens)**, apart from that they do not have continuous fire - the fire will go out after an operation is finished. Furnaces require 2 units of fuel per single operation, i.e. at least 2 wood logs or 1 piece of mineral coal.

## Ores and Metals

Some particulars about smelting certain ores and working with certain metals.

### Kiln-only

**Tin**, **copper**, **gold**, **silver** and **bronze** only need a kiln. Just melt ores in jugs and pots.

#### [Bronze](Full_Crafting_List#bronze)
<img src="assets/images/sheet_bronze.png">

Bronze is an alloy of tin and copper. You need to melt **equal amounts**  (1:1 ratio) of tin and copper ore in the same jug or pot to produce bronze. For example, 1 unit of tin and 1 unit of copper make 1 unit of bronze.

### [Iron](Full_Crafting_list#iron)
<img src="assets/images/sheet_iron.png">
* Smelt raw iron ore in the bloomery to obtain **sponge iron**.
* Work sponge iron at an anvil into usable iron ingots.
* To cast iron tools or weapons with molds, **put iron ingots in a jug or a pot and melt them in a kiln**.

### [Steel](Full_Crafting_List#steel)
<img src="assets/images/sheet_steel.png">
* Smelt raw iron ore in the blast furnace to obtain **pig iron**.
* Work pig iron at the iron or steel anvil into usable steel sheets.
* To cast steel tools or weapons with molds, **put steel sheets in a jug or a pot and melt them in a kiln**.

## Anvils
Anvils are used to forge weapons across the centuries, from ancient swords to muskets and makeshift AK-47s. See the **[Guide to Weapons](Guide_to_Weapons)** for more information on specific weapons and their availability in different ages.

**Using anvils requires 1.7 of the Crafting skill.**

Click anvils with a mold with molten metal or with some metal sheets or ingots to craft metal items.
