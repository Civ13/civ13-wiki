# Research Tree

Civ13's research system is a **tech tree**, not a point pool. Instead of feeding items into a desk to raise three abstract Industrial/Military/Health numbers, your faction builds **research benches**, assigns each one a specific invention to study, and watches it complete — either by passive study over time, by building a working prototype, or by learning it from another faction's research book.

This page describes the tech-tree mode. Check the round's selected research mode first; [legacy modes](../gamemodes/Civilizations_and_Nomads.md#research) work differently. Unlocking a node still requires the recipe to exist in the active map's crafting catalog and your character to meet its skill requirements. In this mode, colored cable recipes and electronics are gated by **Electricity**; possessing a battery does not grant cable access. Laboratory benches and burners use **Apothecary**, while laboratory feedstock dispensers and centrifuges use **Pharmacology**. See [Chemistry](Guide_to_Chemistry.md) and [Power & Batteries](Guide_to_Power.md) for setup.

Completing a node unlocks every recipe gated behind it, faction-wide, permanently.

## The tree: layers and lines

The tree has three intersecting **layers** — Industrial, Military, and Health — each broken into several **functional lines**. Nodes ladder up within a line, but many also cross-reference nodes in *other* layers (e.g. Steel Blades needs Iron Smithing from the Metallurgy line, not just its own Melee line). That's deliberate: it's what makes this a tree instead of three independent ladders.

| Layer | Lines |
|---|---|
| **Industrial** | Toolmaking, Metallurgy, Construction, Production, Textiles, Furniture, Power, Vehicles, Infrastructure, Agriculture |
| **Military** | Melee, Archery, Firearms, Artillery, Armor |
| **Health** | Medicine, Surgery, Sanitation |

See the [full reference table](#full-node-reference) for node eras, study costs and prerequisites.

---

## Eras and baseline research

Every node has an **era tier** (0–8, matching the map's ages). This is the key rule that makes the tree playable instead of a grind wall:

**Main-tree baseline research is granted up to a faction's founding era.** That baseline is frozen: another faction advancing the world does not automatically unlock later nodes for an established faction. Research beyond your baseline must be earned.

Factionless players receive Main-tree baseline nodes up to the current era. A new faction starts with the era baseline at its founding; loaded faction state and map setup still matter.

**Specialist trees**, including Agriculture and Tailoring, do not receive era-based automatic completion. For example, Modern does not grant Irrigation. Unlock its gateway, meet the bench tier and complete the node.

---

## Research benches

A **research bench** is a craftable structure. Assign it one invention from the tree, and it will make progress on that invention — nothing else — until it's done, at which point you reassign it to the next thing.

- **Building one:** costs 8 planks in the default global recipe. You must belong to a faction to build one.
- **Ownership:** a bench belongs to whichever faction built it. It is *not* shared infrastructure between factions.
- **Viewing vs. acting:** anyone can open a bench's interface to see the state of their faction's tree and what's currently being researched. Only the Leader, Research Director, or an appointed Researcher can *change* what a bench is working on, or produce trade goods from it.
- **Reclaiming an abandoned bench:** if a faction dies out completely (no living members left), any other faction under its own bench cap can claim one of its benches. The claimed bench's old research assignment is cleared.

### How many benches can a faction have?

```
bench cap = (1 + current era) + forge bonus slots
```

The cap rises by **+1 automatically every time the map advances an era**, starting at 1 bench in the Stone Age. Beyond that, a faction can buy more slots at a [resource forge](#the-resource-forge-raising-your-bench-cap).

Trying to build (or claim) a bench while at your faction's cap will fail with a warning — build a forge and melt down some coin first.

---

## Faction roles: who can direct research

Three roles can change what a bench researches and produce research trade goods:

| Role | Appointed by | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Leader** | (elected/self-appointed via the existing faction system) | Always has full research authority. Can appoint and dismiss the Research Director and Researchers. |
| **Research Director** | The Leader, at a bench | One per faction. The Leader picks the title (defaults to "Research Director" but can be renamed to whatever fits your faction's flavor). Can appoint/dismiss Researchers. |
| **Researcher** | The Leader or the Research Director, at a bench | Any number of them. Rank-and-file staff trusted to redirect research and produce trade goods. |

All of these appointments happen through a bench's interface — approach any bench your faction owns and use it to appoint, dismiss, or rename these roles. Ordinary faction members can still *view* the tree and bench progress; they just can't redirect research or write trade goods.

---

## How a node gets completed

Every node completes one of three ways, depending on its **mode**:

### 1. Passive study (Analysis mode — most nodes)

The assigned bench ticks forward automatically, once every **10 seconds**, contributing 1 tick per bench per tick. Multiple benches assigned to the *same* node stack additively — two benches on Steelmaking means 2 ticks every 10 seconds toward it, not 1.

A bench must be tier-upgraded to at least the node's **minimum bench tier** before it can work on it at all — see [Bench tiers](#bench-tiers).

### 2. Build a prototype (Prototype mode — 8 key nodes)

Some inventions (Bronze Working, Iron Smithing, Gunpowder, Steam Power, Electricity, Nuclear Power, Mechanized Warfare, Digital Computing) need more than theory — they need a **working prototype**. These require **both** the full passive study **and** the matching prototype item fed to the bench (see the [reference table](#full-node-reference)) — it's an extra requirement, not a shortcut. Whichever you finish second is what completes the node: submit the prototype after study is done and it finishes at once; submit it early and the node completes the moment the ticks catch up.

[Research notes](#research-trade-goods-notes-and-books) still help on these techs, since they grant ticks toward the study half.

**These are the era-changing capstones.** The first time *any* faction completes one ahead of the current era, the **whole world advances into that era**, with a server-wide announcement. Existing factions retain their founding Main-tree baseline; they must earn later nodes. New factions receive the Main-tree baseline of their founding era, while factionless players follow the current Main-tree baseline. Specialist trees do not gain automatic completion. Capstones have a **passive tick cost of 5× the listed base cost** (the tick numbers in the reference table below are the pre-multiplier base values).

### Studying samples (any Analysis/Prototype node)

While a bench is researching a node, you can feed it a **sample**: an existing example of something that node will unlock (reverse-engineering). Since you can't craft the locked item yet, samples have to be looted, traded, or found. Each distinct item type teaches something only once per assignment, and each grants a chunk of ticks. Only works on the bench's currently-selected subject.

### Research queue

A bench can hold a **queue** of nodes (add any not-current tech from its detail popup). As each subject completes, the bench automatically advances to the next still-valid node in the queue, so research staff don't have to re-assign after every finish. Queued nodes whose prerequisites aren't met yet are held until they become researchable. Note: benches only make passive progress while a Leader, Research Director, or Researcher of the faction is actually connected — you can't queue everything and log off to drag the server forward.

### 3. Learn from a book (Book mode — reserved, currently unused)

A mode exists for nodes that can *only* be learned by importing a research book from a faction that already has it — no passive ticking, no prototype shortcut. No current node uses this mode, but it's there for future content that should represent knowledge that can't be independently rediscovered.

---

## Research trade goods: notes and books

Once your faction has completed a node, your Research staff can **write it up** at the bench that researched it, producing an item another faction can use to shortcut the same research. This is a deliberate trade good — sell it, gift it, or use it as leverage in diplomacy.

| | **Research Notes** | **Research Book** |
|---|---|---|
| Write time | 6 seconds | 35 seconds |
| Effect on the buyer's matching node | Grants a tick boost worth **30% of the node's total cost** | **Completes the node outright**, instantly |
| Reusable? | Consumed on use | Consumed on use |

**Writing:** at a bench assigned to a node your faction has already completed, choose to write notes or a full book. Only Leader/Director/Researcher can do this.

**Using someone else's notes/book:** bring it to a bench assigned to the *matching* node (the subject must line up), and feed it to the bench like any other item. Prerequisites still apply — a book can't skip nodes your faction hasn't unlocked the prerequisites for.

Notes work on any tick-accumulating node — which today means every node except the (currently unused) Book-mode. A full book completes any node outright, including Prototype-mode ones, bypassing the need to ever find or build the prototype item.

---

## Bench tiers

A bench starts at **tier 0** and can be upgraded up to **tier 7**. Higher-tier nodes require a correspondingly upgraded bench before they can be worked at all (an untiered bench simply can't be assigned a high-tier invention).

**Era cap:** a bench can never be upgraded above the **current global era** — Stone Age (era 0) caps benches at tier 0, Bronze Age (era 1) at tier 1, and so on, up to the absolute tier-7 ceiling. As the world advances an era, every bench's upgrade cap rises with it. So you can only ever be as advanced as the age you're in.

**Upgrading:** feed the bench copper, silver, or gold **coins** — their value contributes toward the next tier. The cost escalates:

```
value needed for tier T -> T+1 = 80 x (T + 1)
```

So tier 0→1 costs 80 value, tier 1→2 costs 160, tier 6→7 costs 560, and so on. Progress accumulates across multiple items fed in — you don't need one single expensive item.

---

## The resource forge: raising your bench cap

A **resource forge** is a separate structure (one serves your whole faction, not tied to any single bench) that raises your faction's bench cap beyond the automatic per-era increase.

**Feed it copper, silver, or gold coins** — nothing else is accepted. Coins are valued in silver-equivalents:

| Coin | Silver-equivalent value |
|---|---|
| Copper | 0.1 |
| Silver | 1 |
| Gold | 4 |

When you interact with the forge, you're prompted for how many coins to melt (so a full purse isn't accidentally vaporized in one click).

**Cost to grant the Nth bonus bench slot:**

```
silver needed = 300 x (N + 1)
```

The first bonus slot costs 300 silver-equivalent, the second costs 600, the third 900, and so on. Since a coin stack caps at 500, later slots are paid off cumulatively across multiple feedings — progress carries over between visits to the forge.

## Full node reference

**Legend:** *Era* = the node's era tier, used for Main-tree baseline eligibility under the rules above; specialist nodes must be earned. *Ticks* = base passive study cost; Prototype nodes require **5× this cost plus their prototype item**. *Min Tier* = lowest bench tier that can work this node. Era tier alone does not complete research or guarantee a recipe is available in the active catalog.
