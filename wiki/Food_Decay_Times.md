 <small>You won't be able to get enough nutrients to start the Moonshine reaction with the standard methods, which require 10 Nutrients and 5 Enzymes as a catalyst (making 10 Moonshine).</small>

 <small>Any plant, except for wild ones and mushrooms, will die if it drinks all the water, or when a snowstorm or sandstorm occurs.</small>

 <small>Grain can be fed to herbivores: deer, reindeer, elk, dik-diks, cows, goats, sheep, camels and ... mammoths and ... (drum roll) pachycephalosaurs (ba-dum-s-s!).</small>

 <small>Seeds can be fed to granivorous: parrots, chickens, turkeys, geese, pelicans, gulls, crows, pigs, wild boars, monkeys, mice, rabbits, gorillas, gigantopithecus, mammoths, pachycephalosaurs. Oviparous will adds the amount of eggs from seed feeding, i.e. it mean that oviparous will not lay eggs if not feeded with seeds.</small>

 <small>Oviparous can eat seeds from the floor on their own, but this will not add to the number of eggs (bug). Initially, each egg laying female has an egg count of 5. The maximum value of the egg counter is currently 5. If the egg counter drops to zero, then when feeding with seeds, the counter will not increase. This is a bug in the code.</small>

 <small>At this moment, only two egg-laying birds have been implemented: turkeys and chickens. These birds are supposed to lay eggs every 120 seconds, but this is not happening due to a bug. If there is at least one conscious male in area 3 (not a 3x3 area, but a diamond-shaped area 7 wide and 7 high), and there are less than 6 birds in total in this area, not counting males, then a new egg will be fertilized and from it in 2000 seconds can hatch a chick, provided that on the whole map there are no more than 35 of them for turkeys and 50 for chickens.</small>

 <small>To maximize the amount of fuel in a bloomery, furnace (not iron furnace), or oven, add items one at a time for the following stack items: leaves, dry dung.</small>

## Canned food

Any food product can be preserved in cans for long-term (infinite if sealed) storage. Canned food loses half satisfaction (or will be 1.5 times worse with negative satisfaction).<br><br>
There are 3 types of tin cans:<br>
<img src="assets/images/tin_can_small.png">can fit 3 food and fits in pocket,<br>
<img src="assets/images/tin_can.png">can fit 5 food,<br>
<img src="assets/images/tin_can_large.png">can fit 10 food.<br>
After filling it with food cans must be sealed at canner<img src="assets/images/canner.png">.<br>
<img src="assets/images/tools/boneknife.png">Cans can be opened with a knife. Attack the tin can with an empty hand to take the previously canned food.<br>

<small>Every time you put food in a tin can, it will lose satisfaction. Thus, putting food in a tin can and then taking it out and repeating it several times will result food item with very little satisfaction or terrible negative satisfaction.</small>

<br>

## How decay really works?

After creating a new food item, a food tick is triggered after 590-610 deciseconds. Each tick increases the decay timer by 600 (300 if the product not on the floor, 200 if it is in an unpowered fridge, 75 if it is on). If the container is a can, then the timer does not increase.

Food item that has a rotten variant, when the decay timer reaches more than half the time at the time the tick is checked, turns into its rotten version.

If the decay timer of a food item has exceeded its decay, then the item disappears.

Thus, for example, a raw cutlet, being in a refrigerator connected to the power supply, having 15 minutes before decays, will have 120 ticks (one minute each).
At the sixty-first tick, the cutlet will turn rotten. The minimum real time this will happen will be one hour minus one second (3599 seconds), the maximum time will be one hour, two minutes and one second (3721 seconds).
