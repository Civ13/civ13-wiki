# Starter Guide

## Spawning in

  - When you spawn, you will be told the languages you know. Your
    appearance and language will be determined by your spawn location.
  - Your **hunger** and **thirst** levels will both be at 50%.
  - You start out with nothing but age-appropriate clothes on your person. Your first priority will be gathering flint to make a
    flint axe. 
      - Find a large rock and click it on Grab intent - you should
        be able to gather some flint. 
      - Click the rock repeatedly with the flint to sharpen it (you will get a message when it is sharpened).
      - Now go to a tree and click it on Harm intent. This will pull a
        branch from the tree and place it on the ground. 
      - Click the branch with Grab intent to clear the leaves, then click again with Harm intent to pull out the twigs.
      - Use the sharpened flint on the stick to sharpen it, then click the sharpened stick with the flint again to craft
        yourself a trusty flint axe, a tool and a weapon.
  - If it's **winter season** or **Ice Age** map, you also spawn with a
    **fur coat**. Losing this will mean cold and miserable **death** in
    the icy outdoors.

## Crafting Basics

You will need some basic things to survive. At the very start you will most likely be using **wood** to make them.

  - Hit a tree with your flint hatchet and it will be cut down after a
    delay.
  - Get the wood and use it in the active hand to open a crafting menu.

The same mechanic for opening crafting menu applies to all materials.
Activate in hand to open the crafting menu.

## Staying alive

To survive, you will need to keep yourself nourished and warm.

Click your **Thirst** and **Hunger** **icon** on the right side (stomach icon) to
know how you're doing.

**Letting either hunger or thirst reach 0% will cause your body to start shutting down, leading to inevitable death!**

Hunger and thirst affect your **movement speed**, **healing
rates** and **mood**.

Being slow makes you easy prey for predators, criminals, and
cannibals. Malnourishment also makes it easier to catch **[diseases](Guide_to_Medical#diseases "wikilink")**.

### Hunger

The easiest way to get food early on is by killing animals and eating
the meat after cooking it.

  - Find an animal, preferably one that
    doesn't have fangs, claws, tusks, or poison. and kill it with any means (even bare fists work). **Stay away from bears,
    alligators, wolves, snakes, and mammoths.**
  - Use your knife (flint axe works too) on the dead animal with **Harm intent** to butcher it.
  - **Raw meat** causes **food poisoning**! You'll want to **cook** it,
    **stew** it or **dry** it first, but if you're
    starving, food poisoning is the least of your worries.
  - To cook meat, place it on a **campfire** and click the campfire.
    - Campfire is made with **wood logs** ("kitchen" section).
      - You can also roast meat in an **oven**.
  - To **dry** meat, cut the raw steak into **raw cutlets** with a knife, then place
    them on a **dehydrator** and wait.
      - Dehydrators are made of **wood**, but you need some research
        levels.
  - To **stew** meat, place the raw steak into the **cooking pot** after
    filling it with **water**, and wait.
      - Cooking pots are made with **iron ingots**, but again, it
        requires research levels to make.
  - **Cold can kill**. Being caught in a **blizzard** or **winter**
    without proper protection is a very easy way to **die**.

There are many ways to fill your stomach. Even an *unga
dunga* can do it!

### Thirst

The easiest way to quench your thirst early on is by drinking water or
milk, though other liquids like **tea** can also be used.

#### Water

You can get water from **puddles**, any **water tiles (except saltwater - do not drink nor boil it!)**, or **wells**.

  - To drink, you need to make a **mug** from **wood** or **drinking
    glass** from **glass**.
  - **Wells** have disease-free freshwater. You can build them over a
    **puddle** by using with **stone**... if your faction has the
    research levels required.
  - "Raw" water needs to be **boiled** to be 100% safe. Otherwise, you
    have a **chance** of catching **cholera**. Though if you're dying,
    raw water will be a risk you'll have to take.
  - To boil water, make a pot from **tin** or **copper** ingots.
      - **Intermission: MINING BASICS**: You'll need **wood** and **bone**
        for this. Go gather them (bones are obtained by butchering animals),
          - Make a **tool handle** from **wood** ("tools" section).
          - Hold it in the **off-hand**.
          - Activate some **bone** in your **active hand**.
          - Make a **bone pickaxe**.
          - Find a **rock** and use the **pickaxe** on it. **WARNING: BUILD
            MINING SUPPORTS WITH WOOD EVERY 2 TILES OR YOU WILL HAVE A
            CAVE-IN**
          - Grab the **copper or tin ores** and **smelt them** into
            **ingots** in a **campfire**.
          - Use the **ingots** in-hand to craft a **pot**.
  - Fill the **pot** with **water**, place it on **campfire** or
    **oven**, turn it on, and wait for it to finish boiling.
  - Water is then safe to drink. Pour it in your **mug** or **glass**
    and drink.

#### Milk

  - Find a **cow**, **sheep ewe**, or **goat ewe**.
  - Make a **bucket** from **wood**.
  - Use the **bucket** on **help intent** on the animal of choice to
    gather milk.
  - Pour the milk into the **mug** or **glass** and drink.
  - You don't have to boil milk.

Milk is regenerated in the animals over time, so keep them alive, and
you'll never go thirsty.

#### Palm wine

[Palm wine](Guide_to_Cooking#palm-wine "wikilink") could save your life in the desert areas. Follow the steps in the **[Guide to Cooking](Guide_to_Cooking "wikilink")** to make it (glass is made by firing dug sand piles in the campfire).

### Temperature

**Keep an eye out on your temperature icon. If it's flashing blue with a**
**white snowflake, you're freezing up!**

Winter seasons can bring an icy chill that can seriously hurt and slow
you down, or even kill you. Blizzards are especially deadly, and just wearing a fur coat will not cut it, so make sure you have a shelter ready before it is too late.

#### Fur Clothing

Fur clothing can keep you warm in the winter, but it will not save you if you are caught in a blizzard.

You can make fur clothing by skinning large furry animals like **bears**
and **wolves**. <sub>Yes, you can finally skin furries with no
repercussions.</sub>

  - Kill a **bear** or **wolf**.
  - Skin the animal by using the **knife** on **Grab intent**.
  - Collect the pelts and craft **fur coat, boots, headcover and gloves** (you will need to hunt several animals for the whole set).

#### Shelter

Shelter can save you from even the toughest of conditions.

Any roofed area is considered a shelter.

  - **Caves**: There's a reason that stone-age men were called cavemen.
    Look for entrances in rocks. If it has a roof, it will be darker
    inside. That means it will keep snow, cold, and rain out. The
    easiest way of surviving inclement weather. <sub>Make sure that no
    bears live in the cave, though...</sub>
  - **Tunnels / "Mines"**: You can dig into the underground for
    shelter\! All you need is to use a **shovel** in your active hand.
    To craft one, you'll need to make a **tool handle** with **wood logs**, and have **bones** available. With the **tool handle** in
    the off-hand, activate **bone** in the active hand.
  - **Building a Roof**: Target your inner Bob the Builder and build
    your own roof. You'll need **wood logs**.
      - Build **walls** or **roof supports** to prop the ceiling up.
      - Build a **roof builder**, hold it, and activate it in hand while
        facing the tile above which you want to build.
      - You can also build walls with **dirt** or **snow** by using the
        **shovel** directly on the ground. Just use the **dirt** or
        **snow** piles in your **active hand**, then add additional
        material directly to the wall.

#### Fire

Crackling fires will keep you warm even without a coat.

* A **campfire** warms you when you are right next to it, or within 1 tile.
* A **brazier** (made with **stone**) provides more heat and warms you within 3 tiles.
* Both campfire and brazier are refueled by adding **wood**, **coal** and **charcoal**. Brazier could also be refueled with **paper- and cloth-based items**.

### Dangerous animals

The world is teeming with wildlife. Most of them are pretty tame and
easy prey, but steer clear of the big game unless you're a skilled
hunter, otherwise you'll become minced meat yourself\!

You want to avoid these, unless you're robust or need some pelts:

  - Bears (can provide fur)
  - Wolves (can provide fur)
  - Mammoths
  - Panthers & Jaguars
  - Snakes
  - Piranhas (inhabit jungle river waters. Throw some meat in the water if it looks suspicious.)
  - Mosquitoes
  - Alligators

### Night time

You'll need a light source to see in the night and in dark indoor areas.

The basic source of light is the **torch**.

  - Gather some **wood**.
  - Craft a **torch** and click it in hand to light it. Click it again to put it out for the time being.
  - An alternative to the torch is a tiki torch that is stationary and burns for longer and makes for a brighter source of light.

Torches will last for **5 minutes** and then burn out.

  - You can also make lanterns with **iron**. Lanterns require fuel - any form of liquid fuel will do.

For a more **permanent** light source, you can build **braziers** from
**stone**. You can fuel it with any organic matter like wood or
clothing, simply use items on the brazier on **help intent**.
