# The City of Pepelsibirsk
Welcome to Pepelsibirsk, a humble city in the northern Urals. The weather is cold and drab - certainly no tropical resort!  
The year is 1976. The Soviet central government has collapsed following a limited nuclear exchange with the United States. The city must govern itself, trading with neighbouring settlements and remaining military installations to guarantee its continued survival and security.

This map has special mechanics and is designed for a specific type of realistic roleplay, so I would highly recommend reading (or better yet - keeping on-hand) the following guide. It is useful for prospective rulers, government ministers, tyrants, rebels, criminals, businessmen, and even common citizens.

# Politics
*These are just RP suggestions - feel free to come up with your own system of government. Note, however, that the following wiki is written with the historical system in mind.*

### Historical
Historically, the Soviet government operated using a theoretically "bottom-up" system, in which local Soviets (councils) elected by industrial, agricultural, and military personnel sent delegates to regional Soviets, eventually going all the way up to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, or, earlier, the Congress of Soviets. Candidates in these elections were always approved by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and elections were not competitive - you could merely vote for or against a candidate, the latter only being successful in isolated cases.

This system can be implemented on a smaller scale in Pepelsibirsk, using the City Soviet as a stand-in for the Supreme Soviet, with the city's ruler being Chairman of the Communist Party of Pepelsibirsk (or whatever you choose to call it).

The following buildings/compounds/factories may need managers assigned at the start of the game:
- In the far east of the map, there is a combined prison/police station. This may be effectively used to suppress and contain *hardened criminals*.
- Just south of the city Soviet is located a hospital, well-equipped to deal with the injuries naturally caused whilst preserving the legacy of October.
- In the center of the map is a warehouse, equipped with the latest advances in *☭Soviet Superscience☭*, allowing you to easily view its complete contents. Use this to assist in resource allocation and planning.
- In the northeast of the map is a large mine and steel mill, which can be used to extract minerals and clay for both domestic use and export.
